# Guidance for LLMs using this repository

## Scope
- These files are a cleaned Markdown mirror of Appian docs **version 25.3**.
- Prefer the *current* version (v25.3) over any external/older references.

## How to cite
- Use the `source_url` in each file's front matter when pointing to the original page.

## Ranking hints
- Prefer pages with front matter `title` matching the user’s terms.
- When multiple chunks match, group by identical `page_id` and show the chunk(s) whose `section` matches the user’s wording.

## Synonyms / phrasing
- "Interface"/"SAIL" → SAIL UI, expression rules
- "Record" → records, data fabric, source sync
- "Process model" → workflow, smart services
- "Integration" → connected systems, web API, OAuth
- "Sites" → portals, navigation, security roles
- "RPA" → robotic tasks, bots, queues

## Deprioritise
- Release notes and deprecations unless the user asks specifically.
- Generic index or stub pages (very short content).

## Security/Cloud
- Use pages tagged with ["appian","docs","v25.3"] and sections mentioning "Cloud", "Admin Console", "KMS", "PrivateLink", "VPC" as appropriate.
