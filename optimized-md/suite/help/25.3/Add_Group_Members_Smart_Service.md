## Overview

The Add Group Members smart service allows you to add a user (or users) to a group as a step in your process.

### Permissions needed

The Add Group Members smart service can only be executed by a System Administrator, or by administrators of the group in which new members are being added. If this task is assigned to any other user, a runtime exception is thrown and the process will be paused when that user attempts to submit the task generated by this node.

### Properties

-   **Category**: Identity Management

-   **Icon**: ![](images/Smart_Service_Icons/Add_Group_Members.png)

-   **Assignment Options**: Attended/Unattended

## Configuration options

This section contains tab configuration details specific to this smart service. For more information about common configurations see the [Process Node Properties](Process_Node_and_Smart_Service_Properties.html) page.

### Data tab

This tab displays all the inputs and outputs for the node. You can add additional input and outputs, if needed.

#### Node inputs

The default inputs for this node are:
