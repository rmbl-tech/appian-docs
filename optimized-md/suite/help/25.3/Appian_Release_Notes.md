25.3 Release Highlights

Join our [Appian Community team](https://www.youtube.com/@AppianCommunity) and other Appian experts as they dig into highlights from the 25.3 release.

## Release highlights

This release introduces many new features to extend the capabilities of the Appian platform, helping you easily build, maintain, and grow your mission-critical applications.

We're excited to highlight powerful updates to Process HQ, Appian Composer, interfaces, and our AI features that integrate directly into your critical workflows.

### Bring Process HQ to your site

This release, you can now add the [**Reports and Dashboards Library**](process-hq-landing-page.html) from Process HQ as a page in your [Appian Site](Sites.html). This new site page gives your users access to everything they need to view and manage custom reports and dashboards without ever leaving the site.

[![screenshot of reports and dashboards used in a site page](images/rn-25.3/highlights-1.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1660)

[![](images/rn-25.3/highlights-1.png)](#_)

We're also giving you the ability to customize the appearance of the new Reports and Dashboards Library page. You can choose light or dark theme, and even apply your organization's branding for a cohesive look and feel across your entire site.

[![screenshot of reports and dashboards library using the dark theme](images/rn-25.3/highlights-2.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1661)

[![](images/rn-25.3/highlights-2.png)](#_)

### Jumpstart application development with Appian Composer

**Note:**  This feature is available as a preview. Preview features are fully supported; however, they do not reflect the full functionality or performance of the feature yet.

Turn your ideas into working applications faster with [Appian Composer](plan-view.html), an AI-powered capability that transforms how you plan and build applications. Whether you're kicking off something new or building on what you have, Composer helps your team stay in sync and move faster by connecting business and IT from the start.

[![gif of Appian Composer](images/rn-25.3/highlights-3.gif)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1662)

[![](images/rn-25.3/highlights-3.gif)](#_)

Start by describing your idea in plain language, and Composer instantly builds a plan with clearly defined requirements, personas, structured data, and screens. When you're ready, Composer transforms that plan into a working application ready to test, refine, and go live.

[![screenshot showing a list of objects generated by Appian Composer](images/rn-25.3/highlights-4.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1663)

[![](images/rn-25.3/highlights-4.png)](#_)

Each application includes groups, interfaces, record types with summary views and relationships, and a fully configured landing page.

Start with a plan and build what matters together!

### Boost interface performance by loading your data asynchronously

We're excited to introduce a major enhancement to our [asynchronous loading](async_loading.html) capabilities that will dramatically improve the performance and responsiveness of your interfaces. Simply use the new [a!asyncVariable()](fnc_evaluation_a_asyncvariable.html) function to create a local variable that loads separately from the rest of your UI. Parts of your UI that use that variable will temporarily display as a placeholder. This means users can interact with faster loading components, without having to wait for the whole interface to load—perfect for managing the performance impact of external systems you can't control.

We've also improved the performance for asynchronous data so that you can use it on any data that takes more than a half a second to load, not just your slowest-loading components. These improvements will apply anywhere you are already using asynchronous data, including:

-   Grid, charts, and KPIs that use the [_loadDataAsync_ parameter](async_loading.html#how-to-enable-async-loading)
-   [Dashboard](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.1/Appian_Release_Notes.html#asynchronous-dashboard-reports) and [KPI reports](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/24.4/Appian_Release_Notes.html#load-kpis-asynchronous) in Process HQ
-   [Grids](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/24.3/Appian_Release_Notes.html#load-grids-asynchronously) in data fabric insights

[![gif showing async loading in a record summary view](images/rn-25.3/highlights-5.gif)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1664)

[![](images/rn-25.3/highlights-5.gif)](#_)

### Self-managed customers can now harness the power of Appian AI

Appian [AI features](ai-landing.html) are now available for self-managed environments using Appian on Kubernetes! With this release, you can use [Appian AI Copilot](appian-ai-copilot.html) and [AI skills](ai-skills-intro.html) to supercharge efficiency for your processes and people. [Learn more](k8s-0.184.0/appian-ai-aok.html) about the services needed to harness these powerful capabilities in your self-managed Appian environment.

## Appian AI Copilot for business users

Through these features, [AI Copilot helps business users](user-copilot.html) be more productive.

This release improves how you search and get answers. Smart search delivers better results with clearer error details, and the data fabric chatbot now uses smart search to understand intent for more accurate answers.

### Additional AI Copilot features achieve FedRAMP Moderate compliance

We're proud to share that the following AI Copilot features are now certified FedRAMP Moderate:

-   [Smart Search](records-smart-search.html)
-   [Enterprise Copilot](user-copilot.html)
-   [Documents Chat component](Documents_Chat_Component.html)

These features meet the stringent security, privacy, and operational requirements for public sector use, enabling more government agencies to automate complex processes with confidence. Learn more about Appian's [security and compliance certifications](https://trustcenter.appian.com/?view=adfcffa6-eb6b-495d-4d53-690439985a1a).

### Access more insights with expanded smart search results

We are excited to announce the general availability (GA) release of smart search, which was previously available as a preview and is now available as a full part of the Appian platform.

This release, we're making it easier to get expanded search results and more insights.

[Smart search](records-smart-search.html) now returns up to 10 semantic matches from both document fields and long text fields, and supports those results in functions like [a!keys()](fnc_informational_a_keys.html), [a!update()](fnc_array_a_update.html), and [fn!remove()](fnc_array_remove.html).

You can also work with larger data sets—search extra-long text fields (up to 500,000 rows) and other text fields (up to 1.5 million rows). And you'll get actionable error messages plus indexing-failure notifications to help you spot and fix issues quickly. With access to more matches, you can deliver richer insights and greater flexibility when searching across your data fabric.

### Get smarter answers from your data fabric chatbot

The [data fabric chatbot](Data-Fabric-Chatbot-Component.html) can now use [smart search](records-smart-search.html) to understand the meaning behind user's queries, not just keyword matches. For example, if you search for "electricity outage" in the data fabric chatbot, you'll see results that mention a "power failure" or "electricity is down." Now you'll see more accurate and relevant answers, even when questions are asked in unexpected ways.

## AI Agents

AI agents empower you to automate dynamic and open-ended tasks within your business processes. [AI skills](ai-skill-object.html) are design objects that enable you to build and configure artificial intelligence (AI) agents to use in your processes.

This release makes AI agents more capable and easier to configure. AI skills now allow you to use search queries for extracting data from documents and support image files as inputs, helping you build more efficient, accurate automations.

### Extract additional data from documents with search queries

We're adding another tool to your intelligent document processing toolkit. The [Advanced IDP Tools AI skill](create-skill-advanced-idp-tools.html) now supports search queries as a way to extract additional data from documents. Ask questions like, "What is the patient's name?" and receive an answer with page references.

[![screenshot showing extraction using a query](images/rn-25.3/ai-agents-1.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1665)

[![](images/rn-25.3/ai-agents-1.png)](#_)

By providing a powerful alternative when other tools don't capture all the necessary information, this tool enables additional ways for accurate end-to-end automation of document-centric use cases.

### Turn image files into insights with generative AI skills

You can now use JPEG, PNG, and TIFF files, including multi-page TIFFs, as document inputs in [generative AI skills](gen-ai-skills.html)—no conversions or plugins needed. Simply upload your images and let generative AI skills get to work extracting text, analyzing content, and powering your intelligent document processing automations.

The [Advanced IDP Tools AI skill](create-skill-advanced-idp-tools.html) now supports multi-page TIFF files too. You don't need any plugins and document processing is faster and easier than ever before.

### Customize AI prompts at runtime

Now you can dynamically update the prompt used by the [Execute Generative AI Skill smart service](Execute_Generative_AI_Skill_Smart_Service.html) directly in the process model. This is an optional runtime prompt that is used instead of the prompt configured in the AI Skill, giving you a flexible way to adapt your input for your use case without creating or editing additional AI Skill objects.

## RPA

[Robotic process automation (RPA)](rpa-9.17/appian-rpa.html) simplifies how you build, manage, and scale digital workers to handle repetitive tasks across systems. By automating routine processes, your teams can focus on higher-value work that drives innovation and efficiency.

### Lightning-fast load times for robotic task executions

Now you can get to your data even faster. We've improved the speed of the robotic task executions page in the [Operations Console](rpa-9.17/manage-rpa.html), especially for environments with lots of robotic tasks. Thanks to smarter data fetching, some pages now load up to 83% faster. The more robotic tasks you've configured, the bigger the boost.

## Autoscale processes

[Autoscale](autoscale-processes.html) combines low-code design and business process automation with unmatched scalability. In this release, we're making autoscaled processes easier to build and troubleshoot. New output options for the Start Process smart service and improved error messages give you more control over how you work with these processes.

### Improved output of Start Process smart service

You now have more options for how you work with the output data in both your standard and autoscaled processes. With the [Start Process smart service](Start_Process_Smart_Service.html), you can choose to store the output as a variable, store it at an index of a variable, or append it to a variable list. These improvements help you simplify your processes and shape your data to best fit your needs.

[![screenshot showing the outputs section of the Start Process smart service](images/rn-25.3/autoscale-1.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1666)

[![](images/rn-25.3/autoscale-1.png)](#_)

### Better errors and notification emails

This release, we've improved how error notification emails for your autoscaled processes are grouped and summarized, so it's easier to understand what went wrong.

Each error group now includes a concise description of the issue and an example error message with real data to provide context. These updates make it easier for you to quickly identify issues and take action to resolve them.

### Outbound VPN for autoscaled processes

Communication between different parts of your enterprise architecture is essential, and so is the security of that communication. If your organization requires a VPN for communication between systems, autoscaled processes can now use an outbound VPN connection for database and integration calls.

Check out the [best practices](autoscale-patterns-practices.html) to ensure all parts of your enterprise are ready to work with your autoscaled processes.

## Process HQ

Combining the latest technologies in data fabric, process mining, machine learning, and generative AI, [Process HQ](processhq.html) gives business users the power to explore data and identify timely insights they can use to optimize their business.

This release, you'll be able to empower your users to drill down into report charts, create reports faster, and favorite reports and dashboards for instant access. Read on to hear more!

### Drill down into report data

This release, we're adding the ability to configure drilldown reports in [Process HQ](allow-users-to-build-reports.html). With drilldown reports, you can connect different ways of looking at your enterprise data and access more information in a single click.

Use the new **Drilldown Report** option to easily allow users to jump between related reports.

[![screenshot highlighting the drilldown report option](images/rn-25.3/phq-3.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1667)

[![](images/rn-25.3/phq-3.png)](#_)

Then, users can click on a section of the chart to instantly drill down into your report and view detailed data filtered based on your selection. You can even add links to the [record summary view](record-view.html#default-record-views) to connect users with all the information for a specific row of report data.

With drilldown reports, we're giving you enhanced visibility into your datasets and putting more of your enterprise data at your fingertips.

[![gif of drilling down into a report](images/rn-25.3/phq-4.gif)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1668)

[![](images/rn-25.3/phq-4.gif)](#_)

### Report creation where you need it most

This release we've embedded [report creation](manage-reports-and-dashboards.html#create-a-report) right into the [Reports and Dashboards page](process-hq-landing-page.html)—no more need to detour through the [Data Catalog](data-catalog-page.html)! Your datasets are now instantly within reach, so you can build mission-critical reports with lightning speed.

[![CREATE REPORT button highlighted in the Reports and Dashboards page](images/rn-25.3/phq-report-creation.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1669)

[![](images/rn-25.3/phq-report-creation.png)](#_)

### Easier navigation of reports and dashboards

Your users can now [favorite the reports and dashboards](manage-reports-and-dashboards.html#favorite-a-report-or-dashboard) they use the most. Skip the search and dive right into accessing your most important data.

[![LIBRARY list with the favorite star highlighted for three entries](images/dfi-favorite-selection.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1670)

[![](images/dfi-favorite-selection.png)](#_)

Plus, each report and dashboard opens automatically in its own tab to help accelerate your data-driven decisions. And, once you're moving fast and multi-tasking, you'll stay oriented with the unique tab names showing where you are and saving precious navigation seconds.

![Browser tabs showing individual report and dashboard names](images/rn-25.3/phq-tab-names.png)

### Improved selection of related record fields in reports

This release, we've streamlined field selection in [reports](manage-reports-and-dashboards.html) so it's even easier to take advantage of the [relationships](record-type-relationships.html) that unify your data fabric. Pick related fields from a single, unified list for the fastest possible report configuration.

[![gif of expanding field lists for related record types and selecting the Status field](images/rn-25.3/phq-field-selection.gif)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1671)

[![](images/rn-25.3/phq-field-selection.gif)](#_)

## Data fabric

[Appian's data fabric](data-fabric.html) stitches together data from multiple systems into a single, secure data model, so you can build applications quickly. This release, we're excited to introduce more ways to sync your data, document management improvements, and more.

### Schedule incremental syncs on database-backed record types

Last release, we introduced scheduled incremental syncs for your service-backed record types. With this release, you can [schedule incremental syncs](records-data-sync.html#schedule-incremental-syncs) on your database-backed record types too—allowing you to sync changes from your database every few minutes or hours.

Plus, we're giving you the flexibility to [schedule both incremental and full syncs](records-data-sync.html#scheduled-syncs) on your record types, so you can tailor your sync options to best fit your organization's needs.

[![screenshot of the Scheduled Syncs options in the record type](images/rn-25.3/df-1.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1672)

[![](images/rn-25.3/df-1.png)](#_)

That's not all! We've also reorganized the **Sync Options** page of the record type so you can easily configure all of your [sync filters](records-filter-source-data.html) and options in one place.

[![screenshot showing the sync filters option](images/rn-25.3/df-2.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1673)

[![](images/rn-25.3/df-2.png)](#_)

### Monitor and clean up documents from the record type

We've enhanced the [**Documents** page](manage-docs-with-records.html#monitor-documents) of your record type so you can easily view and manage your application documents.

Now, you can filter and sort documents to quickly identify who created the documents and when. And, we've also added a column for the related record name so it's easy to see which documents are associated with which data.

[![screenshot highlighting the sort and filter options for document record types](images/rn-25.3/df-3.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1674)

[![](images/rn-25.3/df-3.png)](#_)

From this page, you can also configure [document cleanup](manage-docs-with-records.html#clean-up-documents) to automatically delete orphaned documents. By default, we'll delete documents without an associated record after 30 days. You can customize this default setting in the [Admin Console](Appian_Administration_Console.html#data-retention), or tailor the cleanup schedule on individual record types as needed.

[![screenshot of the custom settings option for document cleanup in a document record type](images/rn-25.3/df-4.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1675)

[![](images/rn-25.3/df-4.png)](#_)

### Seamlessly configure more performant queries

Fast and efficient queries are the foundation of performant applications, that's why we've improved our record query functions so they reinforce performance best practices.

To avoid querying unnecessary data that slows down your applications, you now [need to specify the exact fields to query](#record-queries) in your [a!queryRecordType()](fnc_system_queryrecordtype.html), [a!queryRecordByIdentifier()](fnc_system_a_queryrecordbyidentifier.html), and [a!recordData()](fnc_system_recorddata.html) expressions.

If you must query all your record fields, you can use the new [a!selectionFields() function](fnc_system_selectionfields.html) within your query functions. To optimize these queries, we'll still exclude fields that are resource intensive to query, like real-time custom record fields and extra long text fields, unless you specify them.

### Enhanced query performance monitoring

Not only are we [improving our record query functions](#seamlessly-configure-more-performant-queries) so it's easier to configure performant queries, we're also introducing more ways to monitor and track your record query performance.

We started by updating the [**Query Performance** tab](monitoring_view.html#query-performance) so you can see how many fields are included in each of your queries. With just a glance, you can see if you're querying more data than you need.

[![screenshot highlighting the total field count column in the query performance tab](images/rn-25.3/df-5.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1676)

[![](images/rn-25.3/df-5.png)](#_)

We've also enhanced the existing [sail\_details.csv](Logging.html#interface-performance-logs) log and introduced a new [interface\_query\_record\_type\_details.csv](Logging.html#interface-query-performance-logs) log to give you a more complete view of the record data that's queried in your interfaces. In these logs, you can now review aggregated, statistical data for query execution times, wait times, and field counts for each record type queried in an interface.

### Automatically scale high throughput query workloads for maximum efficiency

Appian is committed to scaling your data fabric with your growing enterprise. That's why we're introducing the ability to dynamically scale your queries based on your application usage. By automatically scaling your data fabric, Appian optimizes the performance and resource efficiency on your site without any administrative support—streamlining development and reducing risk for your highest volume use cases.

### Query more related data at once

As you build queries in your applications, you'll notice that the [a!relatedRecordData() function](fnc_system_relatedrecorddata.html) allows you to return more data from your one-to-many relationships.

Now, when you reference `a!relatedRecordData()` in `a!queryRecordType()` or in a [records-powered grid](Paging_Grid_Component.html#using-records-powered-grids), you can return up to 100 related records from a single one-to-many relationship. When you reference the function in `a!queryRecordByIdentifier`, you can return even more—up to 250 related records!

### Translate lookup data

[Lookup data](build-best-data-fabric.html#store-lookup-data-in-a-separate-record-type) provides users with information that is vital to their business processes. As such, it's important for you to be able to easily provide that foundational data to each user in their own language. That's why we're making it fast, simple, and reliable to [generate translation strings for lookup data](translation-set-object.html#create-translation-strings-from-a-record-type) directly from the record type.

[![screenshot of turning record field values into translation strings](images/rn-25.3/df-6.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1677)

[![](images/rn-25.3/df-6.png)](#_)

With just the click of a button, you can generate translation strings for the values of a record field and choice list options—up to 50 at a time! Just like with [generating translation strings in interfaces](translation-set-object.html#create-translation-strings-in-bulk-from-an-interface), we'll create a list for you to review and alert you to any duplicates before we convert the values to new translation strings. We do all of the heavy lifting, saving you time, effort, and a whole lot of clicks.

### Calculate business process metrics with record events

Monitoring how long it takes to complete your processes is crucial to understanding how they're performing and where you can make improvements. That's why in this release, we're introducing business process metrics for [record events](record-events.html).

Now, when you [configure record events](record-events-configuration.html) on your record type, we'll also custom record fields that calculate how long it takes to finish your most important processes. If you already have record events configured, you can easily [create this custom record field](custom-record-fields.html) using the new **Calculate Duration** template.

[![screenshot of creating a custom record field using the new calculate duration template](images/rn-25.3/df-7.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1678)

[![](images/rn-25.3/df-7.png)](#_)

Then, you can use [Process HQ](allow-users-to-build-reports.html) to keep an eye on your duration metric, and display the metric alongside your other data in application dashboards or interfaces. With business process metrics in your record types, you can benefit from unparalleled insight into process durations, making it easier than ever to improve your business processes.

### Generate complex record actions with ease

This release we're continuing our ongoing effort to enhance generated record [actions](record-actions.html) and [views](record-view.html) to be more modern and intuitive.

Now, it's faster and easier to build more complex user experiences in just a few clicks. When you [generate a record action](record-actions.html#generate-record-actions), you can now choose whether to include the base record type as well as any one-to-one or one-to-many related records types. This allows you to quickly and easily create all the related actions for your data from one location.

[![screenshot of generating record actions with relationships](images/rn-25.3/df-8.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1679)

[![](images/rn-25.3/df-8.png)](#_)

We're also adding a rich variety of templates to choose from when generating your record actions. These curated form templates allow you to create visually appealing and highly functional record actions with minimal effort.

[![gif showing the list of generated record action templates](images/rn-25.3/df-9.gif)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1680)

[![](images/rn-25.3/df-9.gif)](#_)

We've also streamlined the record view and action generation wizards, making it even easier to configure your record types.

### Sync data from database schemas

Now, when you [configure the source of your record type](configure-record-data-source.html#synced-database), you can choose a database table from any schema or catalog accessible from your connected system. Not only does this make it easier to connect to the data you need, it minimizes the number of connected systems you need to create.

Then, you can create familiar process models using the Write Records smart service to manage the records and related records from multiple schemas. You can even use a single record variable to pass this data if all records are created using the same connected system—streamlining your vital process models.

### Connect to more data with new supported databases

This release, we've expanded our list of [supported databases](System_Requirements.html#databases) to include PostgreSQL 16 and MariaDB 10.11.13 so you can connect to the data you need. Appian Cloud customers will be automatically upgraded to use this version of MariaDB.

## Control Panel

The [Control Panel](control-panel.html) is a workspace for business users to make no-code configurations to data, interfaces, and more. This release, we're continuing to improve the connections between the data in the Control Panel and your data fabric, as well as make quality of life improvements for business users and low-code developers.

### Weave the Control Panel more tightly into your data fabric

We're helping you to strengthen the connection between the data in the Control Panel and the rest of your applications by [allowing you to select which record types](how-to-configure-control-panel-object.html#step-3-configure-and-manage-the-hierarchy) your business users can relate to their case types.

[![screenshot of the Related Data section in the control panel object](images/rn-25.3/cp-1.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1681)

[![](images/rn-25.3/cp-1.png)](#_)

Once the record types are available in the Control Panel workspace, business users can easily [create data fields that point to existing records](creating-case-categories-and-case-types.html#related-data). For example, when a case manager is creating a form to capture customer contact information, the Customer field can point to an existing Customer record.

Not only does this allow end-users to quickly provide helpful data for their cases, but it also gives case workers all the information they need to resolve cases faster.

[![gif of adding a related data field to an intake form](images/rn-25.3/cp-2.gif)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1682)

[![](images/rn-25.3/cp-2.gif)](#_)

### Easier deleting for Control Panel business users and developers

We're happy to introduce a few quality of life improvements for both business users in the Control Panel workspace and low-code developers in the control panel object.

Now, business users can [delete data fields](creating-case-categories-and-case-types.html#adding-and-configuring-data-fields) directly from the Control Panel workspace without heading over to Designer or asking a low-code developer for help.

And, low-code developers in the control panel object can delete [custom configurations](control-panel-object.html#custom-configurations) that were created accidentally or are no longer needed.

### Case Management Studio modules

We're also excited to announce that the modules for Case Management Studio are now compatible with Case Management Studio 2.0, as well as with the Control Panel workspace and object. You can once again leverage the easily configurable pre-built features in our modules to quickly expand your app functionality.

The [Case Creation via Email module](cms-case-creation-via-email-overview.html) is not yet compatible with Case Management Studio 2.0.

## Interfaces

Appian makes it easy to build beautiful, information-dense [interfaces](interface_overview.html) that you can use throughout your applications. This release is filled with tons of impactful improvements, including a records-powered file upload component, sleeker design mode, accessibility improvements, and more.

### Easily configure and preview documents in the file upload component

This release, we've enhanced the way you and your users work with documents in your interfaces.

Now, you can use our improved [document()](fnc_scripting_document.html), [a!documentViewerField()](Document_Viewer_Component.html), and [a!documentDownloadLink()](Document_Link_Component.html) functions in your file upload configurations to allow users to immediately preview and interact with their uploaded documents. Users can even edit the file name and descriptions before submission, ensuring documents have meaningful details from the start.

We've also enhanced the [file upload component](File_Upload_Component.html) so you can configure it to use a [document management record type](manage-docs-with-records.html#required-object) as the source. This way, documents are automatically uploaded to the corresponding document folder—no functions or folder references necessary!

[![gif of uploading a file and configuring it's details](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-1.gif)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1683)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-1.gif)](#_)

### Craft stylish and functional forms with sidebar templates and pane layouts

Designing modern, user-friendly forms is now easier than ever. We've introduced a new [sidebar template](Sidebar_Template.html) for [form](Form_Layout.html) and [wizard](Wizard_Layout.html) layouts, allowing you to anchor your forms with an eye-catching title bar that includes dedicated space for additional details that can include any content you like.

Combining these features makes the complex easy, allowing you to create rich, dynamic experiences with minimal effort.

### Empower all users with an accessible message banner component

Displaying new or changed content on part of the screen and communicating status updates like "Item saved" is a core part of any dynamic interface. Our new [message banner](Message_Banner.html) component makes these updates accessible to everyone by allowing assistive technologies like screen readers to notify users about changes that don't take focus.

This ensures that critical information is accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments. Use this component to easily create great looking message banners while building more inclusive apps that are a joy for all to use.

### Style components with color transparency

We're excited to announce that you can now leverage transparent hex colors in your components to create visually striking designs. Now, when you configure components like buttons, layouts, or tags, you can style them with semi-transparent backgrounds, borders, and decorative bars.

[![screenshot of the color transparency background used in an interface](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-5.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1687)

### Instant summary views for document management record types

When you [generate a document management record type](create-record-data-source.html#generate-a-related-record-type-to-manage-documents), Appian will now generate its [summary view](record-view.html) too, so you can immediately see a document, its details, and its related data.

And, when you [generate a summary view interface](record-view.html#generate-a-record-view) on a record type that has a relationship to a document management record type, we'll automatically include a list of the related documents. Now you can get a centralized and simplified view of how your documents relate to other application data in just a click.

[![screenshot showing attached documents in generated summary view interfaces](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-6.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1688)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-6.png)](#_)

### Align content in the style text editor component

This release, we're adding even more utility to the [styled text editor component](Styled_Text_Editor_Component.html). Users can now easily align text to the left, right, or center of the field. We've also improved the menu bar to provide a better user experience on smaller screens in web browsers. These improvements will make it easier for customers to create organized, well-formatted content in their Appian applications.

[![screenshot of the new alignment options for the styled text editor component](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-7.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1689)

### Build stunning interfaces faster with a streamlined design experience

This release, we've supercharged the interface design experience to make building beautiful, modern interfaces faster and more intuitive than ever.

#### Find the perfect icon with AI-powered suggestions

Choosing the right icon can elevate your design, but searching through a large library can be time consuming. That's why we're extending our popular AI-powered icon suggestions to more places. Now, you'll find the **SUGGEST ICON** button in [KPI](KPI_Component.html), [section layout](Section_Layout.html), [button](Button_Component.html), [stamp](Stamp_Component.html), and [gauge](Gauge_Component.html) components. With a single click, Appian AI suggests relevant icons based on text in the component, like its label or instructions, helping you create polished, professional interfaces in less time.

[![gif of using the suggest icon button](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-8.gif)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1690)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-8.gif)](#_)

#### A fresh new look for component controls

To improve your design experience, we've refreshed the component configuration pane with sleeker, more modern controls.

Boolean parameters, like Read-only and Disabled, now appear as toggles instead of checkboxes.

[![screenshot of the new toggle style for boolean parameters](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-9.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1691)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-9.png)](#_)

Options for parameters like alignment, label position, and milestone style are now represented by icons, allowing for quick selection.

[![screenshot of the icon representation for some parameters](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-10.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1692)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-10.png)](#_)

Selecting colors is now more streamlined and visual, with predefined colors showing up alongside custom colors.

[![screenshot showing both predefined and custom color options in the color picker](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-11.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1693)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-11.png)](#_)

Selection cards have an updated, cleaner look that make choosing a data source or template even easier.

[![screenshot of the new selection cards look](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-12.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1694)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-12.png)](#_)

The _Visibility_ parameter is now named _Show When_ to match expression mode and allows you to easily reuse visibility logic by selecting from available variables.

[![screenshot of the renamed showWhen parameter](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-13.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1695)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-13.png)](#_)

Together, these improvements make it easier than ever to craft the perfect layout and style in design mode.

#### Enjoy a more intuitive workspace

To create a more seamless experience when designing interfaces, we've made it easier to navigate between views in the [interface object](interface_object.html#elements) header. Based on your feedback, we've replaced the view dropdown with a simple toggle to turn on [preview mode](interface_object.html#preview-toggle). We've also added a dedicated button for [performance details](Performance_View.html) and moved the performance trends to this view.

[![screenshot of the preview toggle and performance trends option available while configuring an interface](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-14.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1696)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-14.png)](#_)

#### Design faster with a more fluid experience

We're continuing our mission to make designing interfaces faster. This release, we're not only improving general performance even more, we're also speeding up the feedback loop while you're building interfaces by making design mode more responsive.

When changing values in design mode for most text fields, toggles, and dropdowns, and when adjusting visual elements like colors, margins, or label position, you'll now see your changes reflected in the interface almost instantly. This responsiveness helps you build better user experiences faster.

### More accessible editable grids

This release includes improved accessibility for [editable grids](Editable_Grid_Component.html). Now, when users add a new row to a grid, we'll automatically move focus to the new row, making it easier for users with mobility and visual impairments to navigate the interface.

### Improved accessibility for preconfigured colors

The success, warn, info, and error preconfigured colors will be automatically updated to have a higher contrast ratio for accessibility. Now, if you choose one of these colors for an icon or other component, the contrast ratio will be more accessible and easier to see for all users. This update will make it easier for you to apply consistent, accessible colors to a variety of components.

[![screenshot showing the higher contrast ratio for background and highlight colors ](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-15.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1697)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-15.png)](#_)

### A new look for Appian banners

The banners users occasionally see that are controlled by Appian, such as form-level validations, now have a more modern look. In addition to using the new [preconfigured colors](#improved-accessibility-for-preconfigured-colors), they will no longer have borders and will have a decorative bar.

[![screenshot of the new banner style](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-16.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1698)

[![](images/rn-25.3/interfaces-16.png)](#_)

## Appian Mobile

[Appian Mobile](Appian_for_Mobile_Devices.html) enables users to monitor, collaborate, and take action on their applications, all from the convenience of their iOS and Android device.

### Video recording available on Android devices

Previously only available on iOS devices, the [file upload component](File_Upload_Component.html) now supports uploading videos on Android devices. Android users can select videos for upload or record videos for upload, ensuring a consistent in-app experience.

## Administration

Each release, we continue to give [administrators](Appian_Administration.html) more control over how they manage, secure, and administer their Appian environments.

### Use trusted server certificates with OpenID Connect

Starting this release, certificates uploaded to the [Admin Console](Appian_Administration_Console.html#trusted-server-certificates) will automatically be applied when making identity requests to an OpenID Connect provider. If your single sign-on is configured in-house, this change lets you use self-signed certificates to avoid the cost and maintenance burden of purchased certificatesS.

### Better support for Kubernetes platform security configurations

Appian on Kubernetes images are now more compatible with Kubernetes platforms that specify or assign arbitrary user IDs at runtime. This ensures Appian on Kubernetes runs in environments with strict security policies, such as OpenShift's Security Context Constraints (SCCs).

### Changes to the distribution method of the configure script for server administrators

The [configure.sh](Configure_Script.html#installation) script used by server administrators has been relocated as a standalone artifact on Forum that can be downloaded by customers. This change helped reduce the artifacts size of Appian installers, and allows for more streamlined access to the configure script itself.

## Behavior changes

This section describes behavior changes in Appian 25.3 that impact how you previously used or interacted with an existing feature, functionality, or the platform in an earlier version. This includes any changes that require you to modify your application after upgrading to Appian 25.3.

### Extracting data from RC4-encrypted PDFs not supported

To comply with [FedRAMP High requirements](#additional-ai-copilot-features-achieve-fedramp-moderate-compliance), document extraction AI skills are no longer able to extract RC4-encrypted PDFs when used in a GovCloud environment.

### New location of the configure script for server admins

Server administrators now access the configure script, used for configuring an environment during or after an installation, in a different location. This script is no longer bundled as part of the `.exe` or `.bin` installers, but rather it is a standalone artifact that can be downloaded from Forum.

### Changes to the distribution method of the configure script for server administrators

The [configure.sh](Configure_Script.html#installation) script used by server administrators has been relocated as a standalone artifact on [Forum](https://forum.appian.com/suite/tempo/actions) that can be downloaded by customers. This change helped reduce the artifacts size of Appian installers, and allows for more streamlined access to the configure script itself.

## Evolutions

The following functions, components, or smart services have newer, improved versions in this release. Existing, old versions in your applications will continue to function normally, but will be renamed on upgrade to indicate that they are older versions.

As always, make sure you are using the right version of the docs for your version of Appian. See [Function and Component Versions](function_versions.html) for more information.

### Record queries

We've evolved our query functions like [a!queryRecordType()](fnc_system_queryrecordtype.html) and [a!queryByIdentifier()](fnc_system_a_queryrecordbyidentifier.html), as well as the [a!gridField()](Paging_Grid_Component.html) function, to reinforce query performance best practices.

Now, when you leave the _fields_ parameter empty in any of these functions, only the primary key field from the base record type will be returned. Likewise, if you only reference a relationship in the _fields_ parameter, then only the primary key fields from both the base and related record types will be returned.

[![image comparing the number of fields returned in queries before and after the 25.3 release](images/rn-25.3/evolutions-1.png)![](/suite/help/25.3/images/rn/zoom_magnify_center.png)](#img1699)

[![](images/rn-25.3/evolutions-1.png)](#_)

Additionally, these evolved functions now take advantage of the [_limit_ parameter increase for a!relatedRecordData()](#query-more-related-data-at-once). To make use of this evolved functionality in your record views and record actions, you must [update your record type](update-a-record-type.html).

## Deprecations

The features listed below are [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html) and will be removed in a future release of Appian. Do not begin using deprecated features, and transition away from any prior usage of now deprecated features. Where applicable, supported alternatives are described for each deprecation.

### RPA Queues and Scheduling

To provide a more unified and powerful orchestration experience through Appian's low-code platform (LCP), the RPA queues and RPA scheduling capabilities found in the RPA Console are deprecated as of RPA version 9.17. These features are scheduled for full removal in Appian version 26.1.

**For all customers not currently using legacy RPA Queues or Schedules**: To prevent adoption of these deprecated features, the Queues and Schedule menus are now hidden and can't be accessed in the RPA Console. As part of this change, the Download reports feature has moved from the Schedule menu to the Statistics menu in the RPA Console.

**For customers with existing RPA Queues or Schedules**: These menus will remain visible to you until the Appian 26.1 release. Appian will continue to support you during your transition. In the meantime, be sure to migrate your schedules to Appian process model [timer events](Intermediate_Event_-_Timer.html) and replace queues with LCP patterns.

### Report site pages

You can no longer display [report objects](Tempo_Report_Design.html) as a page in an [Appian Site](Sites.html). Instead, create a page that displays the [Reports and Dashboards Library](#bring-process-hq-to-your-site) or an [interface object](interface_object.html) to include reports in your site.

This change will not affect any existing report object pages in your sites.
