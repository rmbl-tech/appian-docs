What is an Appian Solution?

This video from the [Introduction to Appian Solutions Academy Online course](https://academy.appian.com/#/online-courses/7aef75dd-4dd3-4c46-94ec-ceda22ee86ec) explains what Appian Solutions are and how they help our customers solve common industry-defined needs while reducing time to value.

## New releases

Appian Solutions are out-of-the-box applications built on the Appian low-code platform, designed to solve a specific business problem, streamline a process, or meet an industry need. Though solutions are released independently from the rest of the Appian platform, they leverage many of the latest platform features, bug fixes, and improvements.

Appian Solution versions are backward compatible with the Appian platform, meaning you are not required to install the latest version of your Appian platform any sooner than you want to. However, new solution features that rely on feature availability in Appian require you to install the latest version of your Appian platform version to gain access to those features in your solution. If you decide not to get the latest Appian platform version, your solution will continue to work with your current platform version.

Note the Appian Public Sector Case Management Solution, which is built with a modular architecture, adds new functionality to the Core through add-on modules rather than major version releases. To add new functionality to your Case Management solution, you need to “incorporate” add-on modules with the Core. See [Case Management Solutions support](#case-management-solutions-support) for support policy information for this solution.

## Solutions support

Appian provides 12 months of product support for all Solution versions from the version's general availability (GA) release date. Our Solutions Support team offers several services to ensure the success of your Solution and will be available for assistance regardless of the version you are running. If a code fix is required for an out-of-the-box solution, those will be made available only for supported Solution versions. We recommend regularly upgrading your Solution when new versions are made available. See the latest Release Notes for your Solution for product support expiration dates.

In addition to responding to technical support requests raised through Appian's Case Management site, our Support team works with your teams and provides support for each area described in this section.

### Platform Setup & Configuration

Appian Support will configure your Appian Cloud Sites, deploy your Solution(s) and provide initial login information to your designated Subscription Administrator. Support will also assist you with loading your users, configuring your preferred authentication, and establishing any VPN connections required to integrate resources external to Appian Cloud (LDAP servers, databases, etc.).

### Cloud Health Monitoring

Our Support team monitors the health of your sites 24x7x365. For any monitoring event that indicates a current or potential site impact, Appian Support will create a case to notify your designated support contacts and inform them of remediation steps that Appian is taking or that are required of you.

### Site Management

Our Support team is responsible for keeping your environments current (patching, software updates, etc.). Many maintenance activities happen silently in the background, but you will hear from our Support team whenever a maintenance activity requires downtime for your Solution. In such events, a maintenance window will be scheduled in coordination with your designated support contacts.

### Quarterly Platform Upgrades

Appian releases updates to the platform that powers your Solution(s) quarterly. Our Support is responsible for performing these upgrades but works with your support contacts to notify them of the proposed schedule and expected downtime. You can find information about adjusting the schedule for these platform upgrades here.

### Solution Updates

For Configured Solution customers, our Support team will install the latest version as a managed service when new versions of Solutions are released. Support coordinates these Solution updates directly with your designated support contacts. For **Customized** Solution customers, our support team will notify your support contacts when new versions are released and provide you with access to the new release. Please note that Appian Support does not install the latest version updates for customized solutions. However, Appian does provide assistance installing the latest version for your customized solution, as required, through Appian’s Customer Success or your chosen System Integrator.

### Solution Hotfixes

Occasionally, we may release hotfixes that address issues in your installed solution. We will communicate any high-severity hotfixes that we suggest applying to your sites. For Configured Solutions customers, our Support team will coordinate with your designated support contacts to apply the fix via a support case. Appian's Customer Success or your chosen System Integrator will assist Customized Solutions customers. Other lower-severity hotfixes will be communicated on an as-needed basis. You can decide if you want them applied to your solution if you are impacted.
