_Decimal Array_

 |

Value displayed for the related series.label.

 |
|

Links

 |

`links`

 |

_Array of Links_

 |

Array of values that determine what occurs when a user clicks a data point in the chart. Create links with:

-   [a!authorizationLink()](authorization_link_component.html)
-   [a!documentDownloadLink()](Document_Link_Component.html)
-   [a!dynamicLink()](Dynamic_Link_Component.html)

`color`

_Text_

Overrides the auto-assignment of series color with a specific value. Valid values: Any valid hex color or `"ACCENT"`, `"BLUEGRAY"`, `"GREEN"`, `"GOLD"`, `"ORANGE"`, `"PURPLE"`, `"RED"`, `"SKYBLUE"`, `"LIMEGREEN"`, `"YELLOW"`, `"AMBER"`, `"PINK"`, `"VIOLETRED"`.

 |
|

Show When

 |

`showWhen`

 |

_Boolean_

 |

Determines whether the series is displayed on the interface. When set to false, the series is hidden and is not evaluated. Default: true.

 |

## Usage considerations

### Chart series color

The color of chart series can be defined by an overall [chart color scheme](Chart_Color_Scheme.html) or it can be configured individually. If a user has selected or created a color scheme, they can swap out the color of any individual series.

Users can choose between the assigned color scheme color, the environmentâ€™s [accent color](Appian_Administration_Console.html#colors), a color such as `"SKYBLUE"` or `"BLUEGRAY"`, or a custom color defined by a hex code. Any series configurations will take precedence over the assigned color scheme colors.

## Examples

_To experiment with examples, copy and paste the expression into an interface object._

### Single series bar chart with label, Y-axis title, and no legend

Use the interactive editor below to test out the example code.

### Multiple series line chart with label, X-axis title, Y-axis title, and legend

Use the interactive editor below to test out the example code.
