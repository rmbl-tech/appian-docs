## Overview

![](images/Smart_Service_Icons/Script_Task.png)

The Script Task is used to perform an automated activity (which does not require a user to complete a form).

It is typically used to execute an expression or rule.

## Configuring a script task

To access the task properties, do one of the following

-   Right-click the **Script Task** node on the designer canvas, then select **Properties**.
-   Double-click the node on the canvas.

The **Configure Script Task** dialog displays. By default, the **General** tab is active.

## Configuration options

This section contains tab configuration details specific to this smart service. For more information about common configurations see the [Process Node Properties](Process_Node_and_Smart_Service_Properties.html) page.

### Data tab

The [Data tab](Process_Node_and_Smart_Service_Properties.html#data-tab) displays the node inputs and node outputs for the script task. Typically, script tasks are configured using node outputs.

1.  Go to the **Outputs** tab.
2.  Click **New Custom Output**. The **Expression Properties** for the node output display.
3.  For **Expression**, create an [expression](Expressions.html) to perform your scripted action.
4.  For **Operator**, select an operator from the dropdown list. The default value (`is stored as`) populates a process variable with the data generated by the expression.
5.  For **Target**, select a process variable in one of the following ways:
    -   Select an existing process variable from the list. The list includes all previously-defined process variables with the same data type.
    -   Create a new process variable by clicking . The **New Process Variable** dialog is displayed. See the [**Variables** tab](process-model-object.html#variables-tab) for more information on configuring a process variable.
6.  If you're done configuring the node, click **OK**.
