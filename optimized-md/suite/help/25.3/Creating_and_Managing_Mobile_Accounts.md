## Overview

The first time you open the Appian Mobile app, you will need to add an account to sign in to Appian. After you add an initial account, you can add additional accounts for the same environment or for different environments. This can be helpful if you need to log in with various users while testing.

This page provides instructions for adding, deleting, and switching accounts on iOS and Android devices.

## Server addresses

When you add an account, you need to provide the server address for your environment. For example, `insurecorp.appiancloud.com`. Your Appian administrator can provide you with this information.

When you add the server address, you do not need include the fully qualified path, such as `/suite/sites/` in `insurecorp.appiancloud.com/suite/sites/`.

## Accessing the Accounts screen

From the Accounts screen, you can add, delete, switch, and sign out of accounts, as well as access app settings. Accessing the accounts screen is a little different depending on whether or not there are accounts added to Appian Mobile, and whether or not you are signed in to an account.

To access the Accounts screen:

-   If there are no other accounts added to the Appian Mobile app, tap **SET UP ACCOUNT**.
-   If you are already signed in to an account, tap the menu icon, then tap the accounts icon ( for iOS and for Android).
-   If all accounts are signed out, you will automatically be on the Accounts screen.

### Adding an account (iOS)

To add a new account in the Appian Mobile app on an iOS device:

1.  [Access the Accounts screen](#accessing-the-accounts-screen).
2.  Tap **Add an account**.
3.  Enter the server address. For example, `insurecorp.appiancloud.com`.

    **Tip:**  [Custom Appian Mobile applications](Custom_Mobile_Applications.html) that have device sharing enabled and that restrict users to a specific server will not prompt users for their server address.

4.  Tap **Next**
    -   A dialog displays asking to sign in.
5.  Tap **Continue**.
    -   A sign in screen displays in an in-app browser.
6.  Enter your login credentials to complete authentication.
    -   If the account is validated, you are signed in and the account is added to the Accounts screen.

### Adding an account (Android)

To add a new account in the Appian Mobile app on an Android device:

1.  [Access the Accounts screen](#accessing-the-accounts-screen).
2.  If there is already an account added to the Appian Mobile app, tap the add icon.
3.  Enter the server address. For example, `insurecorp.appiancloud.com`.

    **Tip:**  [Custom Appian Mobile applications](Custom_Mobile_Applications.html) that have device sharing enabled and that restrict users to a specific server will not prompt users for their server address.

4.  Tap **Next**.
    -   A sign in screen displays in an in-app browser.
5.  Enter your login credentials to complete authentication.
    -   If the account is validated, you are signed in and the account is added to the Accounts screen.

### Deleting accounts

1.  [Access the Accounts screen](#accessing-the-accounts-screen).
2.  For iOS devices:
    -   Tap **Edit**.
    -   Tap the delete icon, then **Delete**.
    -   Tap **Delete Account** to confirm.
3.  For Android devices:
    -   Tap the more icon next to the account you want to delete.
    -   Tap **Delete account**.
    -   Tap **DELETE ACCOUNT** to confirm.
