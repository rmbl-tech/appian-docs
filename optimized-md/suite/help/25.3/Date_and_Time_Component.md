## Function

**a!dateTimeField**( _label, instructions, required, readOnly, disabled, value, validations, saveInto, validationGroup, requiredMessage, labelPosition, helpTooltip, accessibilityText, showWhen, marginAbove, marginBelow_ )

Displays and allows entry of a single [date and time](Appian_Data_Types.html#date-and-time) (year, month, day, hour, minute, second). When the field is editable, users can input dates by typing or by picking from a calendar and then select the time from a dropdown. The date and time is shown in the current user's time zone and calendar format.

When working with a [date](Appian_Data_Types.html#date) (year, month, day), use a [date](Date_and_Time_Component.html) component. To display a [time](Appian_Data_Types.html#time) (hour, minute, second), use a [time](Time_Component.html) component. To display a read-only date and time using a custom format, use a [text](Text_Component.html) component.

### Usage considerations

## Calendar formatting and keyboard shortcuts

-   The date is shown in the current user's time zone and calendar format.
-   When focused on the calendar, selecting the **P** key will go to the previous month, the **N** key will go to next month, the **T** key will select today's date, and the **Delete** key will clear the value in the field.

## Examples

Use the interactive editor below to test out the example code.

### Date and time with only a label

### Date and time with a validation
