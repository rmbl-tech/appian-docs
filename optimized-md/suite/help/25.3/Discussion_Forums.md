Discussion Forums have been [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html) and will be removed in a future release of Appian. Support for specifying Forum message storage with a custom XML configuration file (`forums-config*.xml`) or the `change-paths.bat(.sh)` script has also been deprecated.

Use [News](News.html) within the Tempo environment. Tempo offers many benefits, such as mobile support, modern web browser support, improved search functionality, and greater user control through visibility settings and message targeting. See [Social Smart Services](Smart_Services.html).
