This feature has been [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html) and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

Use [a!queryProcessAnalytics](fnc_system_a_queryprocessanalytics.html) and [Charts](SAIL_Components.html#charts) to display your process report data as a chart. For more information about Tempo reports, see [Tempo Report Design](Tempo_Report_Design.html).
