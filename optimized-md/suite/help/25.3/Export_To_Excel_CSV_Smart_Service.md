The Export to Excel/CSV Smart Service has been [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html). There are two new smart services in its place: (1) [Export to Excel Smart Service](Export_To_Excel_Smart_Service.html) and (2) [Export to CSV Smart Service](Export_To_CSV_Smart_Service.html) - which are easy to configure.
