This page contains information related to an old version of the [Form Layout](/suite/help/25.3/Form_Layout.html).

To take advantage of the latest features and improvements, we always recommend you use the latest version whenever possible. See the latest version's page for information about [what's been changed.](/suite/help/25.3/Form_Layout.html#Old_Version)

## Form 17.1

Displays up to two columns of components beneath a title and above buttons. Use this as the top-level layout of start and task forms.

**See Also**: [Dashboard](Dashboard_Layout.html)

**Function**: `a!formLayout_17r1()`

**Parameters**

| Name | Keyword | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Label | label | Text | Optional text to display as the interface's title. |
| Instructions | instructions | Text | Optional text displayed below the field's label. |
| Column 1 Contents | firstColumnContents | Any Type Array | Values that define the contents for the first column in the interface. |
| Column 2 Contents | secondColumnContents | Any Type Array | Values that define the contents for the second column in the interface. |
| Buttons | buttons | Button Layout | Buttons to display at the bottom of the form, arranged using `a!buttonLayout()`. |
| Validations | validations | Text or [Validation Message](Validation_Message.html) Array | Validation errors displayed above the form buttons. Configured using a text array or an array with a mix of text and Validation Message using `a!validationMessage(message, validateAfter)`. |
| Validation Group | validationGroup | Text | When present, the form is only validated when a button in the same validation group is clicked. |
| Donâ€™t automatically focus on first input | skipAutoFocus | Boolean | Determines whether the first input will receive focus when a form loads. Default is false. |
| Show When | showWhen | Boolean | Determines whether the layout is displayed on the interface. When set to false, the layout is hidden and is not evaluated. Default: true. |

**Notes**

-   A button layout must be present for a back button to appear for activity-chained tasks.
-   If the _Column 2 Contents_ parameter is null, the content for the first column displays as in a single-column layout with no space left for where the second column would display.
-   Use form validation messages for problems that are not specific to a single component.
-   Focus will automatically be applied on initial load to the first component in a form that meets the following conditions:
    -   The component is one of the following: checkbox, decimal, dropdown, encrypted text, integer, paragraph, radio button, text
    -   The component is neither read-only nor disabled
    -   The component is not in an initially collapsed section

**Examples**

_To experiment with examples, copy and paste the expression into an interface object._
