This feature has been removed from Appian; it was [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html) in Appian 16.3. You can no longer access the Forms Designer to edit non-SAIL forms, though existing non-SAIL forms still work.

If you are using non-SAIL forms and want to edit them, recreate them as [interface objects](interface_object.html).
