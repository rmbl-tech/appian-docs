This feature has been [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html), and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

Designers can use an [Integration Object](Integration_Object.html) when they want to [pull a document](Integration_Object.html#receiving-a-binary-document) from an external system into Appian over HTTP.
