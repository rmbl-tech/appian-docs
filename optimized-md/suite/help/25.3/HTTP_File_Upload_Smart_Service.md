This feature has been [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html), and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

Now, designers can use an [Integration Object](Integration_Object.html) when they want to [send a document](Integration_Object.html#sending-a-binary-document) from Appian to an external system over HTTP.
