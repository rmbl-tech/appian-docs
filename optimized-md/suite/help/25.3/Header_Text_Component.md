This feature has been deprecated, and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

Use the [heading component](heading-component.html) to display headings with a wider range of color and size options, as well as additional functionality for font weight and heading accessibility tags.

For information about rich text headers, see the [Appian 24.3 documentation](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/24.3/Header_Text_Component.html) .
