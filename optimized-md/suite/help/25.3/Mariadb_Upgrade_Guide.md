<table><tbody><tr><td><i class="bi bi-clouds" aria-hidden="true"></i></td><td><p>This page applies to Appian Cloud only. It may not reflect the differences with <a href="/suite/help/25.3/appian-government-cloud-overview.html">Appian Government Cloud</a>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

This guide has been deprecated because all Appian Cloud customers are now on MariaDB for their Cloud-provided databases by default. If you have any questions, contact Appian Support.
