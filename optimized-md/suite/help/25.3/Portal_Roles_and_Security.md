This feature, along with Portal Pages, Channels, and non-SAIL interfaces, has been [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html) and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

Appian recommends that customers plan migrations of Portal applications to [Sites](Sites.html), Tempo, and [Embedded interfaces](Embedded_Interfaces.html).
