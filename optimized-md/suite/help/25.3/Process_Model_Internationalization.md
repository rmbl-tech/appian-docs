Process model name and description internationalization via subtabs in the Process Model Properties dialog has been [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html) and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

In the past, this capability was required to internationalize related action names and descriptions on record types. As of 18.1, designers can [enter a string or expression](record-actions.html#related-actions) for related action names and descriptions.
