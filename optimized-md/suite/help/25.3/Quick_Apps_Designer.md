The Quick Apps Designer is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Applications created using quick apps will continue to function.

You can speed up your application development by using Appian's data fabric features to quickly generate [database tables](create-record-data-source.html), [record actions](record-actions.html), and [record views](record-view.html).

For information about Quick Apps Designer, see the [Appian 25.1 documentation](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.1/Quick_Apps_Designer.html) .
