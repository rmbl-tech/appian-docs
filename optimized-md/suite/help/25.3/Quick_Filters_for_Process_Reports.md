This feature has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

Use [a!queryProcessAnalytics](fnc_system_a_queryprocessanalytics.html) to display your process report data as a grid. Then use the recipe for [filtering data in a grid](recipe-filter-the-data-in-a-grid.html) to add dropdown user filters. For more information about Tempo reports, see [Tempo Report Design](Tempo_Report_Design.html).
