This feature has been [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html), and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

You will no longer be able to send custom alerts from your process models to the Alerts tab in _/designer_. You can still find system alerts in the Alerts tab.

Use the [Send E-Mail Smart Service](Send_Email_Smart_Service.html) to send messages to users or groups from a process.
