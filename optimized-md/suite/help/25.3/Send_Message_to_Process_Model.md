The ability to send messages to process models from the Setup tab in the Send Message Event smart service has been [deprecated](Deprecated_Features.html) and will be removed in a future release of Appian. Sending message events to process models this way has negative performance impacts.

Use the [Start Process Smart Service](Start_Process_Smart_Service.html) instead.
