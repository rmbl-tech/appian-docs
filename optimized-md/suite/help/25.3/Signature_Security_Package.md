## Customer Audit

On an annual basis, Appian's Information Security team can coordinate a detailed security audit of Appian at a mutually agreed upon time. This can take place onsite or through an equivalent virtual option.

Customers with audit regulations (such as GxP \[Good Practice\], DORA \[Digital Operational Resilience Act\], etc.) are encouraged to subscribe to the Signature Success Plan if they require audit services to meet regulations specific to their respective industry/organization.

## Site Data Audit Requests

Appian Support can work with you to satisfy any reasonable custom site data audit request and maintain this request up to a monthly basis. This includes access to [logs, login audit files, or mail server logs](Logging.html).
