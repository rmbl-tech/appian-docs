## Introduction

Color schemes allow you to create a polished and professional experience across your site while adhering to your company's branding. You can apply the same color scheme to your [site branding](sail/ux-site-branding.html#color-scheme), as well as the [cards](sail/ux-card-layout.html) and [header content layouts](sail/ux-header-content-layout.html#background-color) in the interfaces used for your site pages. This gives your site a consistent style and user experience.

This page will:

-   Provide guidance on using [dark](#consistent-dark-scheme) and [custom](#consistent-custom-scheme) color schemes consistently throughout your site.
-   Provide [examples and hex codes](#dark-color-schemes-details) for each dark color scheme.
-   Provide [links to extensive information and guidance](#further-guidance) on using dark color schemes.

## Using color schemes

When creating your site, you can choose from our selection of dark color schemes or you can create your own custom color scheme. To create a consistent style for your users, use the same color scheme that you select for your site branding across all user interfaces in your site.

### Creating a consistent dark color scheme

There are three dark color schemes to choose from for your sites and interfaces: [Charcoal](#charcoal), [Navy](#navy), and [Plum](#plum).

Only use dark color schemes when you can apply the scheme to all of your site pages. Do not create sites with a mix of dark and non-dark color scheme pages. Dark color schemes shouldn't be applied to pages used on Tempo or across multiple sites with different color schemes.

To use a dark color scheme consistently across your site:

1.  In your site object, go to the **Branding** section.
2.  Under **Try a Dark Color Scheme**, select a dark color scheme.
3.  In the interfaces for your site pages, use a header content layout.
4.  Select your chosen dark color scheme as the value for the header content layout's _backgroundColor_ parameter.
5.  If you're using a card header in your header content layout, enter the site header bar's hex code as the value of the card header's _style_ parameter.
    -   For more information, see our [Header Content Layout color scheme guidance](sail/ux-header-content-layout.html#page-contents-background-color).
6.  Place the interface's content in cards.
7.  Select your chosen dark color scheme as the value for the card layout's _style_ parameter.

### Creating a consistent custom color scheme

Alternatively, you can create a custom color scheme to match your company branding. To create a custom color scheme, you will need to choose a set of site branding colors. These include your header bar color, selected highlight color, accent color, and loading bar color. Once you've selected the color scheme for your site, use them consistently across all interfaces and site pages for a cohesive and professional look.

For more information on custom color schemes for sites and header content layouts, see our [header content layout design guidance](sail/ux-header-content-layout.html#use-a-custom-background-color-to-match-company-branding).

## Dark color schemes details

For each dark color scheme, we've provided an example of the scheme used in a site dashboard and the list of hex codes for the color scheme.

The hex codes correspond to the site's header bar color, selected highlight color, accent color, and loading bar color. For more information on configuring these site branding colors, see [Designing Sites and Portals](sail/ux-site-branding.html#color-scheme).
