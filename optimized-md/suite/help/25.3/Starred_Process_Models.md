The ability to star: Communities, Constants, Document Folders, Expression Rules, Groups, Interfaces, Knowledge Centers, Process Models, and Rule Folders for quick filtering in /designer has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

Designers have greater ability to [find objects in Appian Designer](find_and_search_in_appian.html) search and quick filter options.
