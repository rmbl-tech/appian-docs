## Function

**a!hierarchyBrowserFieldTree**( _label, labelPosition, instructions, helpTooltip, pathValue, pathSaveInto, nodeConfigs, nextLevelValues, accessibilityText, showWhen_ )

Displays hierarchical data in the form of drillable tree.

The Tree Browser Component allows users to vertically navigate hierarchical business objects, each presented as a node with a large image, three lines of metadata, and an optional link.

## Parameters

| Name | Keyword | Types | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|
Label

 |

`label`

 |

_Text_

 |

Text to display as the field label.

 |
|

Label Position

 |

`labelPosition`

 |

_Text_

 |

Determines where the label appears. Valid values:

-   `"ABOVE"` (default) Displays the label above the component.
-   `"ADJACENT"` Displays the label to the left of the component.
-   `"COLLAPSED"` Hides the label. The label will still be read by screen readers; see [accessibility considerations](building_accessible_applications.html) for more information.
-   `"JUSTIFIED"` Aligns the label alongside the component starting at the edge of the page.

 |
|

Instructions

 |

`instructions`

 |

_Text_

 |

Supplemental text about this field.

 |
|

Help Tooltip

 |

`helpTooltip`

 |

_Text_

 |

Displays a help icon with the specified text as a tooltip. The tooltip displays a maximum of 500 characters. The help icon does not show when the label position is `"COLLAPSED"`.

 |
|

Navigation Path

 |

`pathValue`

 |

_List of Variant_

 |

The first value in the pathValue array appears in the uppermost level of the tree and is the root of the visible hierarchy. As the user clicks through the browser, clicked nodes become highlighted. These clicked nodes' values are in the pathValue. They should be stored in a variable, for example local!path. A clicked node's value is used to determine the next level, generated by nextLevelValues. The pathValue must have a default value.

 |
|

Save Navigation To

 |

`pathSaveInto`

 |

_List of Save_

 |

Variable or list of variables to update when a user clicks on a drillable node, as determined by the node configurations. For example, local!path. Use a!save() to save a modified or alternative value to a variable.

 |
|

Node Configurations

 |

`nodeConfigs`

 |

_HierarchyBrowserFieldTreeNode_

 |

Describe how to display a value as a node using a!hierarchyBrowserFieldTreeNode() and fv!nodeValue. This rule or expression is evaluated for each value where fv!nodeValue is any node value.

 |
|

Next Level Values

 |

`nextLevelValues`

 |

_List of Variant_

 |

Given a node value, describe how to get the next levelâ€™s values using the variable fv!nodeValue. For example, rule!CRM\_getCustomerUsersBySupervisor(customer: fv!nodeValue, isActive: true). This rule or expression is evaluated for each value in pathValue where fv!nodeValue refers any value in pathValue.

 |
|

Accessibility Text

 |

`accessibilityText`

 |

_Text_

 |

Additional text to be announced by screen readers. Used only for accessibility; produces no visible change.

 |
|

Show When

 |

`showWhen`

 |

_Boolean_

 |

Determines whether the component is displayed on the interface. When set to false, the component is hidden and is not evaluated. Default: true.

 |

## Usage considerations

### Hierarchy browsers overview

The hierarchy browser tree is a generalized version of the [org chart](Org_Chart_Component.html) in the same way that the [custom picker](Custom_Picker_Component.html) is a generalized version of the [user and group pickers](User_and_Group_Picker_Component.html). The designer has control over what data is shown, how it is retrieved, and how it is displayed, making the component a flexible means of presenting hierarchical business data to users.

For more information on how the hierarchy browser tree works, see the [detailed explanation](#breakdown).

### Using the pathValue and nodeConfigs parameters

-   If a _pathValue_ is not specified, only the _label_, _tooltip_, and _instructions_ will display.
-   All nodes, including non-drillable nodes, can be clicked and saved to the _pathValue_. Non-drillable nodes do not, however, show as having any values in the next level.
-   Each value in the _pathValue_ past the first must be included in the _Next Level Values_ generated by the previous value in the _pathValue_. For example, if _Navigation Path_ is `{1, 10, 100}`, then `10` must be present in the _nextLevelValues_ generated by `1` and `100` in the _nextLevelValues_ generated by `10`.
-   The [function variable](parts-of-an-expression.html#function-variables) `fv!nodeValue` is available when configuring the hierarchy browser tree. It is only available in the _nodeConfigs_ and _nextLevelValues_ parameters.

## Examples

_To experiment with examples, copy and paste the expression into an interface object._

### Hierarchy browser tree example breakdown and explanation

If you want more information on how the hierarchy browser tree's inputs produce the rendered component, read through this section. This section provides a step-by-step breakdown of how the values provided to the component generate the component's data and guide its display. The interface in this section can be created by clicking **Expression mode** ![expression mode icon](images/expression-mode-icon.svg) and pasting the following expression into the **Interface Definition**.

a!localVariables(
  local!path: {5,2},
  a!hierarchyBrowserFieldTree(
    nodeConfigs: a!hierarchyBrowserFieldTreeNode(
      id: fv!nodeValue,
      label: "Node" & fv!nodeValue,
      description: "Description for node " & fv!nodeValue,
      details: "Details for node " & fv!nodeValue,
      image: a!documentImage(document: a!iconIndicator("PREVIEW")),
      nextLevelCount: fv!nodeValue
    ),
    pathValue: local!path,
    pathSaveInto: local!path,
    nextLevelValues: enumerate(fv!nodeValue)
  )
)
```

To configure the tree browser details:

1.  The first step in building the browser is generating the "trunk" of the tree, or path nodes. You provide these values to the component through **pathValue**. ![screenshot breaking down the nodes by one level](images/HierarchyBrowserTreeFlowOne.png)
2.  Next, the component must know how to display these values as nodes. The component gets the display information from **nodeConfigs**. ![screenshot breaking down the nodes by two levels](images/HierarchyBrowserTreeFlowTwo.png)
    -   As the purple text (number two) shows, the display information for the path nodes comes from evaluating **nodeConfigs** for each value in **pathValue**. Each evaluation of **nodeConfigs** needs to produce a [hierarchy browser tree node](Tree_Browser_Node_Component.html). In this example, the first value in **pathValue** is 5. Therefore, the first node, or the root, comes from evaluating **nodeConfigs** with `fv!nodeValue` set to 5.
3.  The component creates a level of nodes for each node in **pathValue**.</li> ![screenshot breaking down the nodes by three levels](images/HierarchyBrowserTreeFlowThree.png)
    -   The orange text (number three) shows that the second and third levels' values are generated by evaluating **nextLevelValues** for the first and second values in **pathValue**, respectively. In this example, the first value in **pathValue** is 5. The component uses this value to generate the second level's values by evaluating **nextColumnValues** with `fv!nodeValue` set to 5. The evaluation produced 5 values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
4.  Finally, the component determines how to display the values produced in step three as nodes using **nodeConfigs**. ![screenshot breaking down the nodes by four levels](images/HierarchyBrowserTreeFlowFour.png)
    -   The green text (number four) shows that the component evaluates **nodeConfigs** for each value generated by **nextLevelValues**.
