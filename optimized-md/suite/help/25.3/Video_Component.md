## Usage considerations

### Supported formats

-   The video formats supported by this component vary by device and browser. Videos of a format not supported by a device/browser will not play in the device/browser.
    -   WebM and Ogg are supported on Chrome and Firefox.
    -   MP4, 3gp, mov, and mpv are supported on iOS devices.
    -   MP4, 3gp, webm, and mkv are supported on Android devices.
-   Videos served over HTTP and HTTPS are both supported. For videos that require authentication, we strongly recommend that you set up single sign-on between Appian and the server that hosts the video so that the video can play without requiring the user to authenticate a second time.

### Appian Documents

`a!videoField()` cannot be used to display videos stored as Appian documents.
