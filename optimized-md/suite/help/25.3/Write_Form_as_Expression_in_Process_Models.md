Configuring your process model start forms and user input task forms via an in-line expression has been deprecated. The **Write an expression** option will be removed from the **Process Start Form** tab and the **Forms** tab in a future release of Appian.

Instead of configuring a form via an expression, directly select an interface and map inputs to your process variables. For more information, see:

-   [Process Model Start Forms](process-model-object.html#process-start-form-tab)
-   [User Input Task](Configuring_the_User_Input_Task.html#additional-configuration-options)
-   [Process Node Properties](Process_Node_and_Smart_Service_Properties.html#form-setup)
-   [Enable Offline Actions and Tasks](enable-offline-actions-and-tasks.html)

Any start form or user input task that was previously configured as an expression will continue to work as expected.
