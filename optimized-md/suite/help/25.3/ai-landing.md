[Appian AI Learning Path](https://academy.appian.com/#/curricula/837117f0-563a-4c0b-b3c4-7a939aee4c81)

Through realistic use cases, learn how to incorporate AI into your Appian applications.

Appian makes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approachable and flexible for a variety of applications and industries. Explore this documentation to learn about how AI can supercharge your automation practice.

## Introduction

You may not always realize it, but you make hundreds – possibly thousands – of decisions a day. From the minute you wake up, you're asked to make choices. What will you have for breakfast? What will you wear? What will you bring with you as you walk out the door?

Chances are you don't make these decisions in isolation. What you have for breakfast depends on how hungry you are. What you wear depends on the occasion. What you bring with you depends on where you're going and what the weather is like. It's a lot to think about!

You might not have to use much brain power to make these choices since you've had a lot of practice. Thanks to that practice, your brain has to work less, and you may have reached the point where this behavior feels like second nature. You consider your options and the circumstances, make a choice, and proceed with your day.

Now imagine if you had to make these decisions in your business processes. But instead of choosing what to eat for breakfast, you need to choose which type of document you're looking at. Imagine having to make this decision 5,000 times in a row. Not only can a computer do this faster, a computer doesn't need to take breaks or sick days. A computer won't get bored and start to make mistakes. A human being would be exhausted with this many decisions, but a computer can do it in minutes.

A human being can train the computer to make these decisions for them using AI. Rather than having to account for every possible scenario, you can train the computer to make decisions based on a number of factors. These decisions are informed by previous experience and related factors, just like your decision to have a croissant for breakfast or bring gloves with you as you leave the house.

## Appian's AI edge

Every day, AI allows people to focus on more critical and meaningful work by delegating routine tasks to intelligent machines and software. Integrating AI capabilities like predictive analytics, natural language processing, or document extraction into your business applications can make your processes faster, more accurate, and more reliable.

Appian provides multiple options and methods for using AI and ML in your business. When you use AI in Appian, you:

-   **Leverage low-code design and deployment methods**: Appian enables citizen developers to create powerful applications and beautiful interfaces without needing a background in software development. Our approach to AI upholds this same value: you don't need to be a data scientist or prompt engineer to build and integrate AI into your Appian applications. Build, train, and launch AI models using low-code.
-   **Tap into your data fabric**. Data is at the heart of AI's transformative power. When you use Appian AI, you can tap into your vast [data fabric](data-fabric.html) across your enterprise and immediately access the wealth of information without complex configurations.
-   **Can be agile and iterative**: Appian [AI Skills](ai-skills-intro.html) are design objects you can use to build, configure, and train an AI agent and then use it in a process model. By building AI with a design object with a modular approach, you can iterate quickly, conduct focused tests, troubleshoot more easily, and integrate your AI agents in multiple process models and applications.
-   **Enable human beings and AI to work together**: AI can't act alone, and many businesses would rarely want it to. Appian is a process platform where people and technology work together when they're needed. You can design your processes to engage a human being when AI needs supervision or verification.
-   **Inherit existing data security**: Security is foundational to every aspect of app development in Appian, and our AI capabilities are no different. Our capabilities are built on [private AI](private-ai.html) and [architected to protect your data](security-compliance.html#foundational-principles) at every step. Additionally, users can only access information related to the parts of the data fabric they have access to. This means that Appian's AI capabilities only return information according to record-level and row-level security rules you have in place.
-   **See a faster time to market and value**: Between low-code design and deployment, quick access to data fabric, and inherited security, you can expect to integrate Appian's AI capabilities into your application quickly and easily, providing value much faster than more traditional development offers.

## How businesses can use AI

Of course, businesses don't need to make decisions about what to wear or what to eat. Instead, businesses need to solve problems related to productivity and efficiency. Among those goals, businesses also need to consider who will build such tools and how to protect the data these tools will rely on. These are big questions to be carefully considered before jumping into AI:

-   **How do you plan to use it? Is AI the best solution for this challenge?** To be worth the investment, AI needs to be carefully integrated into your existing workflows. This type of exploration can take a lot of time and resources to accomplish. Before you begin, it's helpful to determine whether AI is the best fit for your business challenge.
-   **What vendor will you use?** Once you know how and when you want to use AI, you'll want to evaluate the available options. Be sure to consider how the vendor uses your data, discussed in the next question.
-   **How will you keep your data private and within your control?** A publicly available AI tool might be appealing because of the low barrier to entry and no need for in-house development. However, these tools might not be best suited for your business if you wish to keep your data private. Once you send business data to these services, you aren't always able to control how it's used.
-   **Do you have a developer or contractor to build and maintain models?** Custom-built solutions can protect your data, but they can come at a steep cost in terms of hiring a dedicated person or team.

Reading these questions, it might sound like you'll need to make some compromises to harness the power of AI in your workflows. But that's where Appian comes in. Our suite of AI capabilities enables you to build and configure AI models with no code at all. These private AI models are yours and yours alone – no other company or unauthorized person will have access to your training data or production results, guaranteeing your data is protected and always in your control.
