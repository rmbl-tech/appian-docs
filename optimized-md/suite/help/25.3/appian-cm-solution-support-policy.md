## Introduction

Case Management Studio is built on the Appian-platform with a modular architecture where new functionality is introduced through modules rather than major version releases. To add new functionality to Case Management Studio, customers need to incorporate modules. We also expect and encourage customers to configure and extend Case Management Studio to customize the Workspace user experience for their case workers and managers using the power of the Appian platform.

Case Management Studio comes out-of-the-box with the Appian platform. This means that it is covered under the [platform support policy](Product_Release_History.html), not the [Appian solutions support policy](Appian_Solutions_and_Documentation_Support_Guide.html) or the Case Management for Public Sector support policy.

For more information about Appian's platform support policy, see the [Appian Release Support Policy](Product_Release_History.html).
