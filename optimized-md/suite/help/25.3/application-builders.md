The deprecated and full application builders in Appian Designer have been deprecated, and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

Instead, allow Appian to [generate your groups and folders](creating-applications.html#generated-groups-and-folders). Then, [create a record type](Create_a_Record_Type.html) and generate:

-   [Record actions](record-actions.html#generate-record-actions) to allow users to take action on data.
-   [Record views](record-view.html) to display a comprehensive view of your enterprise data.
-   [Event record types](record-events.html) to track and display event history.
-   [Document management record types](manage-docs-with-records.html) to secure, access, and relate documents with your other application data.

Applications that were generated by one of these builders will be unaffected, and the resulting objects will continue to work as designed.

This deprecation only applies to the builder options in Appian Designer. Quick Apps Designer is still a supported way for business users to create and edit applications in Appian.
