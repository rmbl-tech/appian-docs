## Introduction

Connected Claims ships with the AI Chat with Claims module, a pre-built, self-contained application that adds an AI-powered chatbot to the Claim Summary view, enabling claims adjusters to obtain additional claim information by asking the chatbot questions about the claim within the context of the claim record.

This page provides a brief overview of the AI Chat with Claims module and how it can help streamline claim processing in Connected Claims.

## Integrating Appian AI Copilot

Accessing and using effective and intelligent knowledge management tools can have a significant impact on your claims management workflow. The AI Chat with Claims module addresses this issue by bringing the functionality and benefits of [Records Chat Component](../Records_Chat_Component.html) and [Appian AI Copilot](../appian-ai-copilot.html) to Connected Claims. Once incorporated with Connected Claims, the module incorporates a chatbot that leverages AI Copilot into the Claim Record Summary view. This chatbot helps claims adjusters quickly retrieve the claim information they need to complete their tasks more efficiently. This reduces their reliance on manual research methods and the time it takes.

### Quick data capture and retrieval

The chatbot can assist with capturing, organizing, and retrieving claims data to help your claims adjusters quickly access the information they need to process, update, and resolve a claim. It functions as a knowledge assistant, allowing claims adjusters to ask questions about a specific claim within the context of Connected Claims. The right prompt can offer quick access to claim knowledge and intelligent suggestions to help speed up decision-making on active claims.

For example, suppose you were reassigned a high-priority claim that needs to be resolved by the end of the week. It's currently Tuesday, so you need to quickly get up to speed on the claim history and all the work done. Here are some prompts that you can ask the chatbot to get started:

-   You can save time on research by prompting the chatbot to provide a claim summary.

-   There maybe related documentation uploaded to the claim that you want to review. Ask the chatbot what documents are attached to this claim.

-   Now that you have the claim summary and uploaded documents, you can ask the chatbot where you should start.

The AI Chat with Claims module takes the stress out of your claim research. Simply ask the chatbot for assistance.
