## Introduction

Connected Claims ships with the AI Claim Comment Summary module, a pre-built, self-contained application that leverages private AI to analyze and process claim comments then generate a single summary of all the comments for the claim.

By incorporating this module with your Connected Claims Base application, you assist your claims adjusters in understanding and completing their claims, thereby reducing the overall claim processing time.

This page provides a brief overview of the features and benefits of the AI Claim Comment Summary module and how it can help streamline your claims management workflow.

## Leverage Appian AI

AI Claim Comment Summary provides an additional way for you to utilize Appian's AI capabilities in Connected Claims. It allows your claims adjusters to quickly understand all communications on claim. Once integrated, this module automatically retrieves, analyzes, and condenses all comments entered on a claim into a single overview. This allows your claims adjusters to process claims more efficiently since they will not always have to read each individual comment on a claim. In addition, the claim summary is automatically updated whenever comments are created, edited, or deleted on the claim.
