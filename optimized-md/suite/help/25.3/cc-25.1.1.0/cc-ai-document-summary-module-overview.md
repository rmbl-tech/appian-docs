## Introduction

Connected Claims ships with the AI Claim Document Summary module, a pre-built, self-contained application that leverages private AI to analyze and process user-uploaded PDF claim documents and generate a document summary. By incorporating this module with your Connected Claims Base application, you can reduce your overall claim processing time by equipping your claims adjusters with the information they need without the need to open and read claim documents in detail.

This page provides a brief overview of the features and benefits of the AI Claim Document Summary module and how it can help streamline your Connected Claims workflow.

## AI-generated summaries for uploaded PDF documents

After the AI Claim Document Summary module is incorporated with Connected Claims and incorporated into the Workspace, it is designed to automatically generate a summary for uploaded PDF documents associated with your claim records.

This module incorporates private-AI capabilities into the Workspace site and uses Appian's Document Summary AI Skill to analyze each PDF and generate a summary, providing a concise overview of the uploaded documents for easy reference and efficient document management within the Connected Claims application.

Documents can be uploaded to a claim in a variety of different ways. Whether the document was uploaded on claim creation, ad-hoc from the Documents view, or as part of task completion, a summary will be generated and stored for claims adjusters to see through all stages of the claims lifecycle.

Additionally, when a document is deleted, the summary is also deleted to meet your privacy and security requirements.
