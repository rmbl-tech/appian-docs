## Overview

Connected Claims apps use a combination of groups and object security to assign permission levels to users, which can only be configured in Designer.

This page is meant for low-code developers to learn about configuring security for Connected Claims apps.

## Groups in Connected Claims apps

As with most Appian objects and apps, use [groups to set security for objects](../object-security.html#groups-and-role-maps) in your claims management apps. Using groups to set security for your objects allows you to control object access by changing a user's group membership, rather than directly editing the [object's role map](../object-security.html#permission-levels-in-role-maps).

The Connected Claims Base application comes with a number of special, out-of-the-box groups. All groups are preceded by an acronym for the specific application.

| Group Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| All Users | All users who use the application in both Workspace and Studio, including internal users and members of the Design Administrators group. |
| Design Administrators | Members of this group have administrator permission to all objects and groups in the app. |
| Application Users | All users who use the app in Workspace and Studio. This does not include members of the Design Administrators group. |
| Service Accounts | Holds all service account users for the app. |
| Internal Users | All users who would be considered employees or workers that should have access to all claims, such as members of the Claims Adjusters, Claim Examiners, and Claim Supervisors groups. |
| Claims Adjusters | All users who have a claims adjuster role. |
| Claims Supervisors | All users who have a claim supervisor role. |
| Business Groups | A parent group to hold all of the organization specific groups that you create to fit your business's security needs, such as groups for specific departments or teams. |

Use the diagram below to better understand the hierarchy of the Connected Claims groups.

There is an additional out-of-the-box system group for Connected Claims, [Studio Editors](../System_Groups.html#studio-editors), but is not contained in any application. This group is specific to those that can edit objects in Studio and should not be used for object security.

You can easily manage which users are in each of the special Connected Claims groups the same way you can manage any groups in Designer. To learn more about managing groups and membership, see [Group Management](../Group_Management.html).

## Object security in Connected Claims apps

Setting security for objects generated by Studio, such as [interfaces](../interface_object.html#prodlink-security) and [record types](../record-security.html), is the same as setting security for these objects in any other Appian application. Simply edit the object's role map to assign the [Connected Claims groups](#groups-in-connected-claims-apps) the appropriate permission to the object.

By default, all generated record types and interfaces use the following rolemap:

-   Admin: Design Administrators
-   Editor: Claims Supervisors
-   Viewer: All Users

For any record type generated by Studio, you can set [record level security](../record-level-security.html) in addition to [record type object security](../record-security.html). Record level security allows you to set more granular permission levels to specify which users can see which specific records. Within the context of Connected Claims, this translates to which claims, claim types, and claim categories that users have access to.

To determine who can see individual claims, set record level security on claim record types. By default, users associated with the claim and members of the Internal Users and Service Accounts groups can view and edit claims.

To determine who can see a given claim type when creating a new claim from workspace, set record level security on the claim type record type.

To edit custom claim types and claim categories in Studio, you must be included in the record type's rolemap.
