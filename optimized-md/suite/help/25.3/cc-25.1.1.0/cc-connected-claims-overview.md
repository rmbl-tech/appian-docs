## Introduction

Claims management can be daunting for everyone involved, from submitting new claims to maintaining efficient workflows. For many claims, there are lots of moving parts and frequently multiple people involved. This makes it both essential and difficult to keep the entire process running smoothly, get vital information to the people that need it, and ensure that each part of the process addresses the user's and organization's specific needs.

This is where Connected Claims can help. It is a suite of out-of-the-box applications that allow business users to efficiently manage the activities and data for each part of the claims process, as well as independently maintain and customize claims workflows to meet an organization's unique needs.

Connected Claims consists of two parts, [Workspace](cc-workspace-overview.html) and [Studio](cc-studio-overview.html). Workspace is a central site for claims adjusters, claim examiners, and claim supervisors to carry out all of their core responsibilities, from claims intake to settlement.

Studio is a place for business users to configure and customize your organization's claims workflows and processes through simple and intuitive no-code design tools.

## How Connected Claims works

Connected Claims is built on the Appian low-code platform with a modular design. It employs both in-app and extensible design frameworks to ensure that it meets your needs. A set of no-code tools built into Connected Claims enable users of any skill set, even those that aren't trained low-code developers, to customize workflows. And, accompanying modules have pre-built features that are easily configurable and allow you to quickly expand your app functionality. These modern design approaches enable you to create robust, purpose-driven claims management apps without the lengthy development cycles.

In addition to Workspace and Studio capabilities, you can further extend Connected Claims capabilities by incorporating modules built specifically to accompany it, which include:

## Benefits of Connected Claims

Connected Claims is built to help every type of user that is part of your claims process, from the claimant submitting a new claim, to the claims manager, to the claims adjuster refining the claims workflow. Each user can benefit from the next-level user experience, streamlined intake process, intuitive design, highly configurable customizations, and dynamic workflows.

### Next-level experience for both end users and claims adjusters

When people submit a claim to your insurance organization, they are ultimately asking for help, which can be full of uncertainty. How do they know who to talk to for claims information and updates? How long will it take to resolve their claim?

Connected Claims takes the guesswork out of the entire process and simplifies it for both your end users and claims management team by reducing the number of touch points in the user journey.

With Connected Claims, your claims adjusters can access the information and processes they need to submit a new claim and follow it through the entire process. Not only does it give them peace of mind, but the Connected Claims Workspace provides an intuitive and task-oriented system for your claims adjusters. They can efficiently find and complete their tasks and responsibilities in one user-friendly and easy-to-use place.

### Streamlined First Notice of Loss

The claims process begins with First Notice of Loss (FNOL), where the claimant reports their loss and all important details to their insurance company. Connected Claims streamlines the FNOL process by allowing you and your business users to make configurations in Studio to systematically route newly submitted claims to the correct department, streamline the claims intake process and optimize workflow efficiencies. Instead of spending time on the phone or manually monitoring an inbox for incoming requests, your claims adjusters can use that time to resolve claims.

Additionally, your business users can create and manage contacts as related parties within a claim. These related parties can be individuals (e.g., witnesses, drivers) or companies (e.g., repair shops, legal venues). By centralizing the management of all related parties and their roles, Connected Claims provides the tools and capabilities your claims management team needs to streamline the creation and linking of contacts and reduce workflow inefficiencies.

### Intuitive and user-friendly

Workspace offers a fresh approach to managing your claims management process, simplifying the connection points between users and your claims team. Intuitive and modern user interfaces provide the views and data claims adjusters need to make decisions, complete tasks, give feedback to users, and request the additional information or documentation they need to process and resolve claims. Convenient and accessible resources give users the information necessary to understand where they are in the process and what comes next.

### Highly configurable and simplified design process

With Studio, Connected Claims is highly configurable, allowing business users to quickly make customizations that meet the organization's needs. Studio supports a wide range of use cases so your organization can manage many different claims types in a single application.

Additionally, Studio enables you to create robust, complex functionality with simple, easy-to-use no-code design. You can easily create multiple claims types with flexible workflows that can handle complex branching or loopback scenarios through conditional tasks and workflow automations. You can create and modify workflows for all future instances of each claims type, as well as make specific configurations to individual claims types.

### Conditional tasking and workflow visualization

Connected Claims also allows you to dynamically change the workflow for an individual claim by adding or removing tasks and automations to any section of the predefined flow. You can add new tasks and automations sequentially to capture a specific process and even see a real-time visualization of the whole claims process that updates as you add, remove, or complete activities. Multiple task assignment types allow you to intelligently assign tasks in the way that best fits your needs, giving you more control over your workflows.

For example, the Send Email task type allows you to send emails directly from a workflow and create reusable, standardized email templates for those emails. When the workflow is in progress, the send email task prompts the task assignee to send an email using the standardized template configured for that specific task.

### Automation rules for claim assignment

With Connected Claims you can define conditional logic to specify which users and groups cases are initially assigned to, as well as dynamically adjust claim assignment for in-progress workflows. Establish automation rules for claims assignment to assign and reassign claims based on specific events, such as when a claim is initially created or when it’s updated, or when a claim field is updated.
