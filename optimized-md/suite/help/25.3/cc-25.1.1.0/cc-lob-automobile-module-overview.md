## Introduction

Connected Claims ships with the Automobile LOB module, a pre-built, self-contained application that allows organizations to rapidly deploy line of business-specific records to help facilitate the configuration of automobile insurance products in Studio.

By incorporating this module with your Connected Claims Base application, teams can leverage additional records with line of business-specific information to augment their claim.

This page provides an overview of the features and benefits of the Automobile LOB module and how it can help streamline your claims management workflow.

## Predefined claim types and records

This module delivers a standard claim type that can be customized and used for all Automobile line of businesses as well as supplemental records to capture additional claim details like vehicle and accident information to further enrich the claim.

With this module, you can configure the necessary records and relationships for automobile insurance-related claim types in Studio, which would then be visible in Workspace. It also adds a few new fields to the base application that will be available for all claims types and LOBs.

With the Automobile LOB module, your organization can easily update the record fields for any specific data they wish to capture and potentially add other related records.

### Use case: automobile accident claim processing

Imagine a scenario where an auto insurance company needs to process an automobile accident claim. Without the Automobile LOB module, the claims adjuster might have to manually gather and enter specific vehicle details, accident details, and other relevant information. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors.

With the Automobile LOB module, the claims adjuster can quickly capture essential details like: Vehicle Information: Make, model, year, VIN, license plate number, and more:

-   **Accident Details**: Date, time, location, description of the accident, police report number, etc.
-   **Parties Involved**: Driver details, passenger details, witness information.
-   **Damage Assessment**: Detailed descriptions and images of vehicle damage.

This structured data capture ensures that all necessary information is collected consistently, reducing errors and accelerating the claim processing workflow.
