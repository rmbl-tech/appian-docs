## Introduction

Connected Claims ships with the Home Owners LOB module, a pre-built, self-contained application that allows organizations to rapidly deploy a line of business-specific records into their Connected Claims application. This module is specifically designed to facilitate the configuration of home owners insurance products within Studio.

By incorporating this module with your Connected Claims Base application, teams can leverage additional records with line of business-specific information to augment their claim processing and management, making the process smoother and more efficient.

This page provides an overview of the features and benefits of the Home Owners LOB module and how it can help streamline your claims management workflow.

## Predefined claim types

This module delivers a preconfigured claim type for the Homeowners line of business, along with preconfigured studio fields and intake forms. These provide business users with a starting point for their Studio Configurations. Additionally, it includes supplemental records to capture specific details such as property damage, personal property loss, and additional living expenses.

These pre-defined records and fields help ensure that all necessary information is captured accurately and consistently, which is crucial for efficient claims handling.

## Use Case: Managing a Home Owners Insurance Claim

Imagine a scenario where a homeowner experiences water damage due to a burst pipe. Without the Home Owners LOB module, the claims adjuster would need to manually create fields and forms to capture specific details about the damage, personal property losses, and any relocation needs. This process can be time-consuming and error-prone.

With the Home Owners LOB module, the claims adjuster can quickly capture essential details using preconfigured fields and records, such as:

-   **Property Damage**: Detailed descriptions of the damage to the building, including photos and repair estimates.

-   **Personal Property Loss**: Inventory of damaged or lost personal items, with valuations and proofs of ownership.

This structured data capture ensures that all necessary information is collected systematically, reducing errors and speeding up the claim processing workflow.
