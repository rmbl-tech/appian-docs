## Introduction

Connecting Claimâ€™s modular architecture allows you to extend the base application with additional features and functionality to meet your specific use case and business needs. These additional capabilities are integrated with the Connected Claims base application via add-on modules. Each module extends your application with features that allow your team to increase their efficiency and output.

For example, would you like to intake additional property details or add vehicle data to your claim? Our LOB Supplemental add-on modules provide these functionalities and more, giving you complete control over how you want to customize your Connected Claims application.

Ready to begin? Unlock the full potential of Connected Claims with our modular add-ons and streamline your claims management process.

## LOB Supplement modules

The LOB Supplement add-on modules provide your organization with the capabilities and records they need to configure products for specific lines of business directly in your Connected Claims application.
