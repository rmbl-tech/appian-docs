## Introduction

Connected Claims ships with the Workers Compensation LOB module, a pre-built, self-contained application that allows organizations to rapidly deploy a line of business-specific references, groups, records, workflows, and tasks. This allows for a head start with Studio configurations for their Workers Compensation claims management process.

By incorporating this module with your Connected Claims Base application, teams can leverage our best practices for setting up tasks and workflows as well as augmenting their claims records with line of business-specific information.

This page provides an overview of the features, benefits, and use case of the Workers Compensation LOB module and how it can help streamline your claims management workflow.

## Predefined claim types

## Use case: managing a lost time workers compensation claim

Consider a scenario where an employee sustains an injury at work and files a workers compensation claim for lost time. Without the Workers Compensation LOB module, the claims adjuster would need to manually gather and track various details related to the workplace injury, medical treatment, time off, lost wages, and return-to-work status.

With the Workers Compensation LOB module, your claims adjuster can leverage pre-built features to:

-   **Record Claim Details**: Utilize predefined claim types to categorize and manage the claim appropriately.
-   **Capture Incident Details**: Record specific information about the workplace injury, including the date, time, location, and description of the incident.
-   **Track Medical Treatments**: Document all medical treatments received by the employee, including doctor visits, therapies, and prescriptions.
-   **Manage Lost Wages**: Calculate and track lost wages based on the employee's salary and time off work.
-   **Coordinate Return-to-Work Process**: Monitor the employee's progress and manage the return-to-work process, including any accommodations or restrictions.

This structured approach ensures that all critical information is captured and tracked effectively, streamlining the claims process and facilitating timely resolutions.
