## Introduction

Connected Claims ships with the Surveys and Questions add-on module, a pre-built, self-contained application that enables admin users to create reusable questions, organize them into surveys, and assign those surveys as tasks within the claims workflows. Once integrated with your Connected Claims application, this module enhances data collection, standardization, and efficiency for claims processing. With this module, your claims examiners and adjusters will be able to complete survey tasks directly from their workbench.

This page provides a brief overview of the Surveys and Questions add-on module and how it can help streamline claims processing in Connected Claims.

## Integrating the Survey and Question module

When you enable the Surveys and Questions add-on module in your Connected Claims application, admin users gain access to new interfaces in Studio, where they can maintain a central Question Bank, create comprehensive Surveys, and then tie those surveys directly to Survey Tasks in your claims workflow. This process provides the following core capabilities:

### Create and Manage Questions

Admin users can add new questions with response types - such as short text, choice list, or number fields - to a question bank that serves as the single source of truth for all survey items. Once a question exists in the bank, it can be reused across multiple surveys, ensuring consistency in data capture. The question bank automatically tracks which surveys reference each question. If a question is actively used, it can’t be deleted or deactivated until it’s removed from the relevant surveys, ensuring no accidental disruptions to your survey configurations.

### Assemble Surveys from Reusable Questions

Admin users can group those questions into surveys. Surveys can be dedicated to a specific area of claims, such as property damage or personal injury, or they can be broader questionnaires that apply to multiple workflow stages. Questions can be reordered or marked as required so adjusters and examiners don’t miss critical information during data collection.

### Assign Survey Tasks in a Claims Workflow

Admin users can configure a Survey task type and associate it with one or more workflow. This task can be plugged into any existing workflow, enabling examiners and adjusters to see a consolidated list of questions in their workbench whenever they reach that survey step.

## Streamlined, Consistent Data Collection

By leveraging reusable survey questions, you can ensure that every claims examiner or adjuster collects the same information across similar claim types. This significantly reduces miscommunication and improves the completeness of data, accelerating the overall claims process.

For example, imagine you frequently handle auto insurance claims. You might create a reusable set of questions for assessing vehicle damages, including time of incident, location of damage, and claimant statements. Once you add these questions to a single “Vehicle Damage” survey, you can use the same survey for every auto claim—ensuring standardized and consistent data collection.

## Seamless Integration into Existing Workflows

Since the module natively ties survey tasks into your Connected Claims processes, your examiners don’t need to leave their primary interface to complete or review survey responses. Surveys appear as discrete tasks in the workbench, letting users complete them as part of their normal daily activities with minimal context switching.

Suppose a property damage claim requires several follow-ups, including site inspection, policy validation, and claimant statements. By assigning a survey task to each of these follow-ups, examiners can quickly check off the required questions in one place. This helps keep the workflow clean and ensures that every piece of important data is collected before moving on to subsequent steps in the claims process.

The Survey and Question module takes the stress out of repetitive, ad-hoc data gathering by centralizing the creation and maintenance of questions and surveys, enabling you to maintain consistent standards across all of your claims processes.
