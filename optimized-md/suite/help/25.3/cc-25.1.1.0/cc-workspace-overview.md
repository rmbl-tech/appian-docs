## Workspace

Workspace provides a focused, task-oriented environment with everything your claims adjusters and managers need to quickly and efficiently perform their core responsibilities as part of your organization's unique claims management process.

Workspace consists of four pages:

-   [Workspace](#workspace-page)
-   [Claims](#claims-page)
-   [Customers](#customers-page)
-   [Policies](#policies-page)

### Workspace page

The **Workspace** tab serves as the homepage for the Workspace site. It features the **My Workspace** view, which provides claims adjusters access to crucial information about their assigned claims and tasks. This page allows them to track key performance indicators (KPIs), view all tasks assigned to them or a group, stay updated on assigned claims, and see upcoming claim and task due dates. From here, they can also create new claims.

The **Due Dates** section provides flexible views that give claims adjusters greater control over how they want to view upcoming due dates for their claims and tasks. Easily switch between a list view and calendar view.

### Claims page

The **Claims** page serves as a central hub for claims data. It consists of the **All Claims** list, which displays only the claims you, as the logged in user, have access to and a section for suggested claims that you should follow up on.

Perform a keyword search of this list to find a specific claim record or use the filters to find all claims that match specific criteria. After locating the claim you want to follow up on, open it to access the **Summary** view to see an organized view of the claim data.

![Workspace Claims Summary Tab](images/cc_workspace_claims_summary.png)

This tab provides general claim information, loss details, milestones, related claims, any active and resolved tasks associated with the claim and comments. You can leverage AI Copilot in the Summary view and interact with a chatbot to quickly retrieve the claim information you need to complete your tasks more efficiently and reduce your reliance and time on manual research methods.

You can also close or clone the claim, add a policy, and update the claim’s data, assignees, watchers, and tags all from the Summary tab.

Drilling into the claim record also gives you access to various tabs with other important claim data.

| Tab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Incident Details** | This tab allows you to view and update the claim’s loss details, related parties, injuries, and exposure details. You can also update the claim’s liability decision. |
| **Financials** | This tab provides a breakdown of the claim’s reserves, payments, and transaction history. You can also initiate a payment on the claim, manage the loss, expense, and recovery reserves, and settle the claim. |
| **Cost Estimate** | This tab provides a summary of the estimated costs for the claim, including metadata like the cost category, description, estimated amount, date created, and creator. View KPIs of the total estimated damage, costs for the highest estimated category, and the loss reserve balance. |
| **Tasks** | This tab shows a list of tasks organized by task type. Each task includes metadata like status, assignee, due date, and location within the workflow visualization. You can view the total number of resolved tasks versus the total number of tasks for each task type, and you can edit the workflow by adding, deleting, and reordering both individual tasks and task blocks. |
| **Documents** | This tab provides a list of all documents uploaded to the claim, including metadata like document type, date, and the user who uploaded the document. View public documents and private documents that you have access to. You can also upload ad-hoc documents to the claim record from this tab. |
| **History** | This tab displays a timestamped log of all actions taken on the claim, including the user who completed each task. Search and filter the history log to find a specific task and expand each task to see more details. |
| **Related Actions** | This tab displays a list of shortcuts for all the actions that can be performed on the claim. |

Additionally, this page also has a bulk update feature that allows you to select and edit multiple claims at once. Modify the claim details like the assigned group or user, priority, due date, watchers, and more.

### Customers page

The **Customers** page consists of the **All Customers** list. From this list, you can drill into a customer record to access the **Summary** view to see specific details about the customer.

From this page, you can also search the All Customers list to find a specific customer or use the **\+ CREATE CUSTOMER** action to create a new customer record.

### Policies page

The **Policies** page allows users to view all policies in the Connected Claims system. From this list you can access a specific policy and view its details including coverages and deductibles and any claims that have been submitted against this policy. Note that policy records are likely to be integration backed from a customer's existing policy administration system.
