## Introduction

For life insurers, balancing speed and accuracy is critical to the underwriting process so insurers can accurately price policies for new customers while managing their risk exposure. Appian Connected Underwriting (CU) Life Workbench empowers insurers to accelerate the underwriting process and improve customer experience by reducing the time to quote and integrating disparate data sources to create a single 360-degree view.

This page provides a quick overview of how Appian Connected Underwriting Life can help insurance organizations improve their speed to quote.

## What Does Appian Connected Underwriting - Life Provide?

### Data ingestion with guided wizards and APIs

CU Life Workbench monitors and processes incoming applications 24/7 in real time from channels such as e-applications with our solution API. A guided wizard also helps underwriters ingest information manually.

### Auto-assign cases to teams

With the CU Life Workbench you can automatically assign and route newly submitted cases to the correct team. This allows your underwriters and underwriting managers to streamline the case intake process and optimize workflow efficiencies. Instead of spending time on the phone or manually monitoring an inbox for incoming requests, your underwriters can use that time to resolve cases.

### Enhanced case management

CU Life Workbench provides a single pane of glass from which an underwriter can orchestrate their work across their various systems, including ordering and managing requirements, work assignment and keeping meticulous notes, event history and reports.

### Conditional tasking and workflow visualization

The CU Life Workbench also allows you to dynamically change the workflow for an individual case by adding or removing tasks and task blocks to any section of a configured workflow. As you add and remove tasks and task blocks to configure a specific process, the application allows you to see a real-time visualization of the whole case managment process.

### Augmented Decision Making

With CU Life Workbench, underwriters can quickly visualize recommended decisions from their rules engines to help guide requirements ordering and case decisions. Carriers that use Swiss Re’s Magnum Pure rules engine are able to integrate out-of-the-box with CU Life Workbench so that underwriters can easily view and expand the Magnum decision down to the impairment level for cases that come into the workbench.

### Admin Control

The CU Life Settings site allows business users with the appropriate permissions to quickly make changes to users and group security to keep the business running securely. Additionally, the Auto Assignment add-on module allows business users to create rules that dictate how new cases will get assigned to Assignment groups.

## Extending CU Life Workbench

In addition to the out-of-the-box capabilities that ship with CU Life Workbench, you can further extend the solution's capabilities by incorporating add-on modules built specifically to accompany it. These include [AI](cul-ai-module-landing-page.html) and [Productivity](cul-productivity-module-landing-page.html) module that allow you to leverage Appian's platform capabilities and functionalities.

### End-User Reporting

The End-User Reporting add-on module provides the ability for any privileged user to create reports that can be saved to a dashboard for frequent use and generated on demand. Once incorporated, the End-User Reporting module allows underwriting teams to construct a number of different report types, perform various analyses on them and easily share them, with “no code” involved.
