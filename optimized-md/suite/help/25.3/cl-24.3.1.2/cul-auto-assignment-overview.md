## Introduction

One of the most common challenges underwriting teams face is getting the right cases to the right teams as quickly as possible. Additionally, once cases are routed to the correct teams, underwriting managers need to ensure work is evenly distributed across the team. To tackle these challenges, many underwriting managers rely on a manual process to assign and route incoming cases to the right people. However, this approach can be slow and error-prone. It can lead to an imbalanced work distribution, resulting in reduced productivity and longer case resolution times.

For example, suppose you manage several underwriting teams, where each team has a specific responsibility for handling cases of a particular type or category. Currently, you have to manually evaluate each new case to determine which team should handle it, then assess each team member's active work to decide who can take on a new case. This approach is not only time-consuming but can also create a bottleneck for your teams who are processing and closing cases. To address this issue, you need a way to create business rules that automatically route new cases to the appropriate team.

The CU Life Workbench ships with Auto Assignment, a pre-built module that allows underwriting managers and admins to streamline the case assignment process by creating rules that automate case assignments and routing to teams. This module adds functionality that enables underwriting managers and admins to configure case assignment rules based on the case category, case type, and any other standard or custom case fields added through Studio. See [Installing Auto Assignment](cul-auto-assignment-module-installation.html) and [Setting Up Auto Assignment](.) for more information.

After setting up the Auto Assignment add-on module with the CU Life Workbench-on, underwriting managers and admins can access the Assignment Rules site to define business rules that automatically assign incoming cases to teams based on the rule logic. This eliminates the manual case assignment step and reduces the time it takes to process a case.

This guide provides a brief overview of the Auto Assignment add-on module and how it can help streamline the underwriting process in the CU Life Workbench.

## Auto Assignment

Want to provide your teams with greater flexibility to manage assignments and ensure they have visibility into the right cases? Or ensure your managers can effectively balance workload distribution across their entire team? Integrating the Auto Assignment add-on module with your CU Life Workbench lets you streamline your underwriting process by automating case assignments to groups or team members based on pre-defined case conditions.

For example, suppose you have a large underwriting team working on cases with values exceeding $100K. In that case, the Auto Assignment add-on module allows you to configure a rule to automatically assign and route cases to this team when the case value exceeds this amount.

After installing and integrating the Auto Assignment add-on module into your CU Life Workbench, the application creates a user-configurable assignment wizard as part of the CU Life Settings site. This will allow your administrators and underwriting managers to configure case rules that automatically assign and route cases to the appropriate underwriting team when they match specific case criteria.
