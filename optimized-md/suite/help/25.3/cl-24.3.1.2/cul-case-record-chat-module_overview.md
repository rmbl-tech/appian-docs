## Introduction

Connected Underwriting (CU) Life Workbench ships with the Case Record Chat add-on module, a pre-built, self-contained application that adds an AI-powered chatbot to the Case Summary view, enabling underwriters to quickly obtain additional case information by asking the chatbot questions about the case within the context of the case record.

This page provides a brief overview of the Case Record Chat add-on module and how it can help streamline case processing in the CU Life Workbench.

## Integrating Appian AI Copilot

Accessing and using effective and intelligent knowledge management tools can have a significant impact on your case management process. The Case Record Chat add-on module addresses this issue by bringing the functionality and benefits of [Records Chat Component](../Records_Chat_Component.html) and [Appian AI Copilot](../appian-ai-copilot.html) to the CU Life Workbench. Once incorporated with your CU Life Workbench, this add-on incorporates a chatbot that leverages AI Copilot into the Summary view of the Case record. This chatbot helps underwriters quickly retrieve the case information they need to complete their tasks more efficiently. This reduces their reliance on manual research methods and the time it takes.

### Quick data capture and retrieval

The chatbot can assist with capturing, organizing, and retrieving cases data to help underwriters quickly access the information they need to process, update, and resolve cases. It functions as a knowledge assistant, allowing underwriters to ask questions about a specific case within the context of the CU Life Workbench. The right prompt can offer quick access to cases knowledge and intelligent suggestions to help speed up decision-making on active cases.

For example, suppose you were reassigned a high-priority case that needs to be resolved by the end of the week. It's currently Tuesday, so you need to quickly get up to speed on the caseâ€™s history and all the work done. Here are some prompts that you can ask the chatbot to get started:

-   You can use the chatbot to quickly determine whether the case has related documentation.

-   You can save time on research by prompting the chatbot to provide a case summary.

The Case Record Chat add-on takes the stress out of your cases research. Simply ask the chatbot for assistance.
