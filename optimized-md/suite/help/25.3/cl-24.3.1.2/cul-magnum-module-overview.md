## Introduction

Appian offers pre-built integrations that allow you to extend your CU Life Workbench capabilities by incorporating feature-rich add-on modules. The Magnum Pure add-on module provides underwriters with a rules engine, allowing them to efficiently collect and assess risks for life insurance applications, streamlining the acquisition process.

## Magnum Pure integration

The Magnum Pure integration is an influential automated underwriting solution powered by Swiss Reâ€™s Life Guide. It helps underwriters better evaluate and classify risk, handle exceptions, and make critical case decisions, spending less time on procedural and administrative steps, transactions, and keystrokes.

With the Magnum Pure integration, a rules engine allows your underwriters to capture the information they need to process and assess the risk for a new life insurance application, simplifying and accelerating the process of capturing new business.

See [Integrating Magnum Pure](cul-magnum-add-on-module-installation.html) to incorporate the Magnum Pure add-on module with your CU Life Workbench.
