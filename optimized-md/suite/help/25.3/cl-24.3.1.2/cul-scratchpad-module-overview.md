## Introduction

The Scratchpad integration provides your underwriters with a digital note-taking tool that allows them to add contextual information directly to a case under review.

## Scratchpad

Once the Scratchpad add-on module is integrated with your CU Life Workbench, your underwriters can do away with external note taking tools like sticky notes and notebooks for capturing and recording important case details. The Scratchpad integration allows them to capture additional case notes directly in the CU Life Workbench, and control whether or not they want to convert the text into a public or private note with relevant risk factor tags.

**Note:**  The Scratchpad Add-on module integrates with Connected Underwriting Life Workbench version 1.1 and later.
