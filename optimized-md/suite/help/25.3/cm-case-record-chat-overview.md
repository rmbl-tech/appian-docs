## Introduction

Case Management Studio ships with the Case Record Chat module, a pre-built, self-contained application that adds an AI-powered chatbot to the Case Summary view, enabling case workers to obtain additional case information by asking the chatbot questions about the case within the context of the case record.

This page provides a brief overview of the Case Record Chat module and how it can help streamline case processing in Case Management Studio.

## Integrating Appian AI Copilot

Accessing and using effective and intelligent knowledge management tools can have a significant impact on your case management workflow. The Case Record Chat module addresses this issue by bringing the functionality and benefits of [Records Chat Component](Records_Chat_Component.html) and [Appian AI Copilot](appian-ai-copilot.html) to Case Management Studio. Once incorporated with Case Management Studio, the module incorporates a chatbot that leverages AI Copilot into the Case Record Summary view. This chatbot helps case workers quickly retrieve the case information they need to complete their tasks more efficiently. This reduces their reliance on manual research methods and the time it takes.

### Quick data capture and retrieval

The chatbot can assist with capturing, organizing, and retrieving case data to help case workers quickly access the information they need to process, update, and resolve a case. It functions as a knowledge assistant, allowing case workers to ask questions about a specific case within the context of Case Management Studio. The right prompt can offer quick access to case knowledge and intelligent suggestions to help speed up decision-making on active cases.

For example, suppose you were reassigned a high-priority case that needs to be resolved by the end of the week. It's currently Tuesday, so you need to quickly get up to speed on the case history and all the work done. Here are some prompts that you can ask the chatbot to get started:

-   You can save time on research by prompting the chatbot to provide a case summary.

-   You can use the chatbot to quickly determine whether the case has related cases or is a standalone case.

-   Were you assigned a case with a lot of missing information, and you don't know where to start? Ask the chatbot to fill you in on all the missing details.

-   Now that you have a good idea of what's missing. You can ask the chatbot where you should start.
