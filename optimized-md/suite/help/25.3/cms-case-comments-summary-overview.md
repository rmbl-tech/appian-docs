## Introduction

Case Management Studio ships with the Case Comments Summary module, a pre-built, self-contained application that leverages private AI to analyze and process case comments then generate a single summary of all the comments for the case.

By incorporating this module with your Case Management Studio Base application, you assist your case workers in understanding and completing their cases, thereby reducing the overall case processing time.

This page provides a brief overview of the features and benefits of the Case Comments Summary module and how it can help streamline your case management workflow.

## Leverage Appian AI

Case Comments Summary provides an additional way for you to utilize Appian's AI capabilities in Case Management Studio. It allows your case workers to quickly understand communications on a case. Once integrated, this module automatically retrieves, analyzes, and condenses all comments entered on a case into a single overview. This allows your case workers to process cases more efficiently since they will not always have to read each individual comment on a case. In addition, the case summary is automatically updated whenever comments are created, edited, or deleted on the case.
