## Introduction

Case Management Studio ships with the Case Document Summary module, a pre-built, self-contained application that leverages private AI to analyze and process user-uploaded PDF case documents and generate a document summary. By incorporating this module with your Case Management Studio Base application, you can reduce your overall case processing time by equipping your case workers with the information they need without the need to open and read case documents in detail.

This page provides a brief overview of the features and benefits of the Case Document Summary module and how it can help streamline your case management workflow.

## AI-generated summaries for uploaded PDF documents

After the Case Document Summary module is incorporated with Case Management Studio and incorporated into the Workspace, it is designed to automatically generate a summary for uploaded PDF documents associated with your case records.

This module incorporates private-AI capabilities into the Workspace site and uses Appian's Document Summarizer AI Skill to analyze each PDF and generate a summary, providing a concise overview of the uploaded documents for easy reference and efficient document management within the Case Management Studio application.

Documents can be uploaded to a case in a variety of different ways. Whether the document was uploaded on case creation, ad-hoc from the Documents view, or as part of task completion, a summary will be generated and stored for case workers to see through all stages of the case lifecycle.

Additionally, when a document is deleted, the summary is also deleted to meet your privacy and security requirements.
