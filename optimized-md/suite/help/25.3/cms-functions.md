The functions specific to Case Management Studio and the Studio site are no longer required and have been deprecated. These functions do not work with Case Management Studio 2.0, the Control Panel workspace, or the control panel object. These functions will be removed in a future release of Appian.

Use the native functionality of the [Control Panel workspace](control-panel.html) and [object](control-panel-object.html) instead.

For the functions for Case Management Studio, see the [Case Management Studio 1.7 documentation in 25.1](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.1/cms-functions.html).
