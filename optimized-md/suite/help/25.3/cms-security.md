## Overview

Case Management Studio apps use a combination of groups and object security to assign permission levels to users, which can only be configured in Designer.

This page is meant for low-code developers to learn about configuring security for Case Management Studio apps.

## Groups in Case Management Studio apps

As with most Appian objects and apps, use [groups to set security for objects](object-security.html#groups-and-role-maps) in your case management apps. Using groups to set security for your objects allows you to control object access by changing a user's group membership, rather than directly editing the [object's role map](object-security.html#permission-levels-in-role-maps).

The Case Management Studio base app comes with a few out-of-the-box groups.

| Group Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CMGT All Users` | All users who use the application in both Workspace and Studio, including internal users and members of the Design Administrators group. |
| `CMGT Design Administrators` | Members of this group have administrator permission to all objects and groups in the app. |
| `CMGT Application Users` | All users who use the app in Workspace and Studio. This does not include members of the Design Administrators group. |
| `CMGT Service Accounts` | Holds all service account users for the app. |
| `CMGT Internal Users` | All users who would be considered employees or workers that should have access to all cases, such as members of the Case Workers and Case Managers groups. |
| `CMGT Case Workers` | All users who have a case worker role. |
| `CMGT Case Managers` | All users who have a case manager role. |
| `CMGT Business Groups` | A parent group to hold all of the organization specific groups that you create to fit your business's security needs, such as groups for specific departments or teams. |

Use the diagram below to better understand the hierarchy of the Case Management Studio groups.

You can easily manage which users are in each of the special Case Management Studio groups the same way you can manage any groups in Designer. To learn more about managing groups and membership, see [Group Management](Group_Management.html).

### Control Panel Users group

In addition to these Case Management Studio specific groups, the Control Panel Users system group also comes out-of-the-box and allows users to [access the Control Panel workspace](control-panel.html#access-the-control-panel). Users or groups must be added to this group by a system administrator. This does not apply to the CMGT Case Managers group, which is included in the Control Panel Users group by default.

The Control Panel Users group should only be used to grant users access to the Control Panel and should not be used to set object security. Also, this group is at the environment level, meaning it is not contained within an application.

To learn more about security for the Control Panel workspace and control panel object, see [Control panel object security](control-panel-object-security.html).

## Object security in Case Management Studio apps

Setting security for objects generated by the Control Panel, such as [interfaces](interface_object.html#prodlink-security) and [record types](record-security.html), is the same as setting security for these objects in any other Appian application. Simply edit the object's role map to assign the [Case Management Studio groups](#groups-in-case-management-studio-apps) the appropriate permission to the object.

By default, most generated record types and interfaces use the following rolemap:

-   Admin: CMGT Design Administrators
-   Editor: CMGT Case Managers
-   Viewer: CMGT All Users

### Record type security for Case Management Studio

For any [record type generated by the Control Panel](control-panel-object-security.html#security-for-generated-record-types), you can set [record level security](record-level-security.html) in addition to [record type object security](record-security.html). Record level security allows you to set more granular permission levels to specify which users can see which specific records. Within the context of Case Management Studio, this translates to which cases, case types, and case categories that users have access to.

To determine who can see individual cases, set record level security on case record types. By default, users associated with the case and members of the **CMGT Internal Users** and **CMGT Service Accounts** groups can view and edit cases.

To determine who can see a given case type when creating a new case from workspace, [set record level security on the hierarchy record type](control-panel-object-security.html#record-level-security-on-the-hierarchy-record-type).

See the [control panel object security page](control-panel-object-security.html#security-for-generated-record-types) to learn more about security for the record types generated by the Control Panel for Case Management Studio.

## Case category and case type security

You can also limit who can view and make configurations to each case category and case type in the Control Panel workspace by setting security on individual case categories and types in the control panel object. See the [control panel object security](control-panel-object-security.html) page for more information.
