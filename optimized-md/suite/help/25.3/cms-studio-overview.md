The Studio site for Case Management Studio has been deprecated. You can now configure your case management applications using the [Control Panel workspace](control-panel.html) and the [control panel object](control-panel-object.html).

Learn more about using the [out-of-the-box Case Management Studio control panel object](how-to-configure-control-panel-object.html) and [configuring Case Management Studio in the Control Panel Workspace](configure-cms-control-panel.html).
