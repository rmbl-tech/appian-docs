Have you ever wanted to…

-   Embed **Google Maps** to select locations and pass them into an action?
-   Capture signatures using **DocuSign** without leaving the task form?
-   Drag-and-drop files to **Box** in an action and store the metadata in a record?
-   Add a custom picker field or slider component that matches your company branding?

Appian has a [fantastic array of components](SAIL_Components.html) that can be used to build beautiful and [powerful user interfaces](sail/home.html). The UI SDK lets developers extend those powerful capabilities by creating new components that can bring the power of other systems right into their interface objects.

For more information, see:

-   [Configuration Files](reference-manifest.html): Provides reference information about the configuration files used to define your component plug-in.
-   [Package Structure](reference-structure.html): Describes the required ZIP structure for component plug-ins.
-   [JavaScript API](reference-js-api.html): Provides an API reference for JavaScript developers and outlines which components can be used in your interface.

Build components to:

-   Integrate with external systems directly from your user's browser or mobile device.
-   Speed up development by using any of your existing custom code in Appian.
-   Craft interfaces that adhere to your organization's branding.

**Note:**  Before you invest time developing a custom component plug-in, [review the interface components available](SAIL_Components.html) in the Appian platform to see if an existing component meets your requirements. Be sure to explore the [SAIL Design System](sail/home.html) as well for inspiration and design guidance.

## Built for integration

Component plug-ins are part of the UI SDK which gives developers the ability to integrate with third-party systems and design custom SAIL components. They offer developers flexibility when needed, allow for more complex integrations than the [web content](Web_Content_Component.html) component, and can be paired with [connected system plug-ins](connected-system-plug-in-landing.html) to access secure data.

## Built for web developers

Component plug-ins are created by developers using standard web languages like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can pull in [third-party libraries](component-ext-libs.html) to quickly build powerful components.

## Built for sharing

Component plug-ins can be listed on the Appian [AppMarket](https://community.appian.com/b/appmarket) where Appian customers can find and use them. We [review](component-review-process.html) all submissions to ensure they meet our standards for customer use.

## Built for low-code

Once installed by an Appian administrator they're available to any Appian developer when they create [interfaces](interface_object.html) in their application. Your custom components are used just like the components that ship with Appian. They're fully interactive, with the ability to both send and receive data from the interface.
