## Introduction

This page provides a quick overview of all the ways Appian Connected Servicing can help your organization. If you would like a more comprehensive overview of the solution, check out Using Connected Servicing starting with the [Home Page Overview](home-page-overview.html)

## Simplify and accelerate your customer lifecycle management

Customers' needs change and grow throughout their time with your organization. It is vital to respond quickly and accurately to any requests that your customer might have in order to keep them happy. Ensuring that the littlest details don't slip through the crack is a great way to build trust and grow your business.

Lack of coordination, poor visibility, or an inability to quickly adapt to your customers' changing needs can cause strain. Commercial-off-the-shelf products and manual processes that rely on spreadsheets and emails are too rigid and slow to respond to this dynamic environment.

Built on the Appian low-code platform, Connected Servicing offers adaptability, extensibility, and speed-to-market. You can fast-track customer requests with a solution that can be configured to your own unique and complex processes.

## What does Appian Connected Servicing provide?

### Customizable process templates

Create workflow templates that will automatically assign tasks based on the type of service request. These workflow templates use a guided experience to walk you through configuring the tasks needed for all your workflows all from one central location. Notice a task that is always being reassigned or marked not needed? Update the template so end users don't have to manually update it each time.

Have a large amount of accounts to service? Use our template bulk management workflows to manage bulk actions like deleting and updating templates for these needs.

### Automated efficiency

With Connected Servicing, you'll receive:

-   Connectors to many of the industry's leading data providers.
-   Document classification using Appian's Intelligent Document Management (IDP).
-   Framework for using Appian's Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to complete tasks in other systems.

### Full transparency for a single view of the customer

Ensure everyone in your organization is on the same page by using the power of Appian Records and Appian data fabric to combine data from your legacy processes, systems, and checklists together into a single platform, all while keeping your data right where it is. Break down barriers and clarify the status of customer requests through a single view for each of your customers.

### Document management for fewer errors

Connected Servicing allows you to upload, manage, and track the status of documents related to your service requests. You can verify information in certain documents and track required documents directly in a customized document approval flow. Appian's Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) will automatically classify your documents in order to ensure that the correct documents are being reviewed.

### Up-to-date security through organizational changes

Organizational change is a fact of life. Quickly respond to changes in your organization with the ability to update security group membership from an easy-to-use interface. Whether it's employees changing teams or leaving the organization, Connected Servicing is flexible enough to allow you to update access quickly.

### Secure, fast, and integrated processes

De-risk your deployment with the security, scalability, and reliability your customers demand. Rapidly respond with a flexible configuration that adapts to your organization's style and processes. Fast-track customer requests with integrations that fit your unique workflows and environment.
