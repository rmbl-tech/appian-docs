## Introduction

Appian Connected Underwriting (CU) P&C empowers insurers with a powerful tool to accelerate the underwriting process and improve customer experience. This page provides a quick overview of how Appian Connected Underwriting P&C can help insurance organizations improve their time to quote.

CU P&C provides a single application to consolidate disparate data sources. By reducing the time needed to gather critical information, organizations can accelerate their ability to provide accurate quotes.

If you want a comprehensive solution overview, check out Using Connected Underwriting P&C, starting with the [Workbench Overview](my-workbench.html).

## What does Appian Connected Underwriting P&C provide?

Appian CU P&C streamlines the business-to-quote process by automating the ingestion, clearance, and triage of information needed for an underwriting Submission. The Submission is the key record in underwriting activities.

They are created in two ways:

1.  Via emails received from insurance brokers.
2.  Manually created by an underwriter.

### Data ingestion

CU P&C uses a variety of features and capabilities to ingest, extract, and analyze data to accelerate your underwriting process and help you and your team make better business decisions. For example, the solution leverages Appian AI Skills to extract critical data from shared inboxes and incoming submissions. By extracting critical information needed for review, your underwriters are empowered to make the decisions necessary to lead the underwriting process and reduce the time to quote.

Additionally, CU P&C integrates with Process HQ to provide deeper insights into your submission data and underwriting processes. This helps you identify process inefficiencies and enables you to make informed decisions to enhance your procurement workflows.

CU P&C also ships with the Guidewire Quote module, which streamlines the quote generation process. Once integrated with the solution, the Guidewire Quote module allows your underwriters to submit new business requests from CU P&C and have the data automatically sent to Guidewire. In addition, you can check your submission against existing customers, create a new customer, create a job, and pass the information downstream.

### Submission clearance

Connected Underwriting allows underwriters to keep track of broker correspondence with AI message summaries, quickly respond with automated emails and follow-ups, ensure submission data completeness, comply with sanctions regulations, and alert underwriters if duplicate submissions exist.

### Triage

With Connected Underwriting, underwriters can quickly prioritize workloads based on their business needs. Underwriters can filter for new business submissions or renewals and sort submissions based on their submission scores, which are powered by their business rules.
