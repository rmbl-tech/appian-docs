## Introduction

Appian offers pre-built integrations that allow you to extend the capabilities of your Connected Underwriting P&C solution by incorporating feature-rich modules. The Guidewire Quoting 1.1 module enables you to pass submission data from your CU P&C solution to Guidewire so your underwriters can generate quotes for multiple lines of business in Guidewire's PolicyCenter.

This guide provides a quick overview of all the benefits of the [Guidewire module](#streamline-quote-creation) and how it can help you streamline your underwriting process.

## Streamline quote creation

The Guidewire Quote 1.1 module can streamline your quote generation process by allowing your underwriters to submit new business requests from Connected Underwriting P&C and have the data automatically sent to Guidewire. Once the two systems are connected through an [Appian Connected System object](../Connected_System_Object.html), you can check your submission against existing customers, create a new customer, create a job, and pass the information downstream.

This eliminates the manual data entry step typically required to generate quotes and reduces system silos that burden your process. With the Guidewire Quote module you can automatically send your submission data from your CU P&C solution to Guidewire for use in its quote generation workflow, saving time and enabling a more seamless experience across the different tools.

In addition, starting with the Connected Underwriting P&C 1.5 release, the Guidewire Quoting 1.1 module allows your admins to easily map Appian coverage fields to Guidewire coverage values directly from the Admin Settings site.
