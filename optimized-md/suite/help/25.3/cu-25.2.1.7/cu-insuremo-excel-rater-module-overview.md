## Introduction

CU P&C ships with the InsureMO Excel Rater module, a pre-built application that streamlines premium calculation by integrating Excel-based rating models directly into the underwriting workflow. Once integrated with your CU P&C solution, this module enables your underwriters to see a dramatic reduction in the time spent on premium calculations.

This page provides a high-level overview of the key benefits you gained when you integrate this module with your CU P&C solution.

## Accelerate quoting with dynamic premium calculation

The InsureMO Excel Rater module significantly speeds up the quoting process by allowing Connected Underwriting P&C to call rating models directly from InsureMO via API. Traditionally, premium calculations often relied on static, hard-coded logic within systems, making updates cumbersome and time-consuming. With this integration, you can maintain your rating logic in Excel and simply upload updated files to InsureMO to reflect new rates.

Upon request, premiums are calculated in real time as you fill out the submission and can be updated whenever relevant factors or parameters change.

This ensures that your pricing is always accurate and up-to-date, eliminating the need for manual recalculations.

This module provides immediate feedback on pricing changes as data is entered, streamlining the quoting process. This leads to faster quote generation and improves you and your team's ability to respond to market demands. Additionally, system administrators can easily update rating models by simply uploading new Excel files to InsureMO.
