## Introduction

Appian offers pre-built integrations that allow you to extend your Connected Underwriting P&C solution's capabilities by incorporating feature-rich modules. The first of these integrations supported by the CU P&C solution allows you to summarize message threads with the help of OpenAI.

This guide provides a quick overview of all the benefits of the [OpenAI Messaging Summary module](#openai-messaging-summary) and how it can help you streamline your underwriting process.

## OpenAI Messaging Summary

The Azure OpenAI module can be used to generate message thread summaries. It lets your underwriters quickly scan their inboxes and identify high-priority messages requiring immediate attention. After selecting a message thread with multiple entries, your underwriters can choose if they want to read each message in the thread or click **SUMMARIZE** in the AI Smart Summary box to generate a summary of the message thread.

When generated, the CU solution briefly summarizes the entire conversation at the top of the message thread. This allows your underwriters to quickly get up to date on case communications, effectively reducing their response time to make critical case decisions.
