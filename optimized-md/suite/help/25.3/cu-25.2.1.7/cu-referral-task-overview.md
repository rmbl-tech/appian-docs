## Introduction

Connected Underwriting (CU) P&C ships with the Referral Task module, a pre-built, self-contained application that allows underwriters to create a new task that assigns their submission to a peer or manager for review.

This page provides a brief overview of the Referral Task module and how it can help streamline the submission review process in CU P&C.

## What does the Referral Tasks module offer?

### Simplify and automate submission reviews

With the Referral Task module, applies a new task type to the task creation process that enables underwriters and managers to create a new review task directly from the submission record.

Once this module is integrated with the CU P&C solution, the new task type, Referral Tasks, is added to task creation process. When selected, users can create a task that assigns the submission to a specific user, such as another underwriter, manager, or external broker, for review. Users can add a task description to define the task and provide context and link relevant documents to the referral task that require a review. In addition, they can also set a review deadline to ensure the submission process stays on track.

After the referral task is created, the assigned reviewer can access the task directly from the related submission, view the task details, including the task referrer. The reviewer can also approve or reject the review task, reset the due date, preview and review any linked documents, and add comments. Note that comments are required when a user rejects the review task. Note that While the referral task is active, the Submission is updated to a _hold_ status.

## Review status and resolution

The Referral Tasks module simplifies the tracking and completion of reviews by providing visibility into the review process for both the assigned user and the task creator. Both users can view referral task completion details, including referral status, decisions, comments, and linked documents.
