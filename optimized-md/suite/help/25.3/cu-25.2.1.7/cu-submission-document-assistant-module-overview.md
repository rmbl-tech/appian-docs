## Introduction

Connected Underwriting (CU) P&C ships with the AI Submission Document Assistant module. This pre-built, self-contained application utilizes private AI to analyze and process user-uploaded PDF submission documents. It enables users to generate a summary of PDF documents upon request and to ask an AI chatbot questions about these documents. By incorporating this module with your CU P&C Base application, you can reduce your overall underwriting processing time by equipping your underwriting team with the information they need to process submissions effectively without the need to open and read submission documents in detail.

This page provides a brief overview of the features and benefits of the AI Submission Document Assistant module.

## AI-generated summaries for uploaded PDF documents

After the AI Submission Document Assistant module is incorporated with your CU P&C solution, it is designed to automatically review and generate a summary for uploaded PDF documents associated with your submission records.

This module incorporates private-AI capabilities into the Workbench site to analyze each PDF and generate a summary, providing a concise overview of the uploaded documents for easy reference and efficient document management within the CU P&C. When a document is deleted, the summary is also deleted to meet your privacy and security requirements.

## Chat with documents

Reading through submission documents to find specific details needed to process the submission can be time consuming. Once the AI Submission Document Assistant module is incorporated with your CU P&C solution, you can engage with an AI chatbot to gain insights into PDF documents attached to the submission. The chatbot acts as a knowledge assistant, providing the information you need, complete with source citations for quick verification.
