## Introduction

Connected Underwriting P&C comes with a number of groups provided by default. By adding internal users to these groups, you can grant access to separate parts of the solution.

There are two categories that the default groups belong to:

### Role Groups

-   These groups represent the different business roles that will interact with the solution and grant access to select solution functionality.
-   Examples include **Underwriterâ€™s Assistant** and **Manager**.

### Assignment Groups

-   These groups are how submission assignment is delineated.

## Default groups

This page lists the default groups provided with Connected Underwriting P&C, and what actions members of the security groups can perform.
