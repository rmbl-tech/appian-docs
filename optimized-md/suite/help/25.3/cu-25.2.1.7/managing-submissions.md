## Introduction

When you [create a new submission](create-new-submission.html), Connected Underwriting P&C automatically creates a new Submission record, which allows you to review submission information, risk details, tasks, alerts, and much more.

![cu-create_new_submission-submission_record.png](images/cu-create_new_submission-submission_record.png)

## View submissions

You can view submission records from the MY WORKBENCH and SUBMISSIONS pages. You can also search and filter the Submissions list from either location to return only the submission records you want to see.

![cu-manage_submissions-submissions_filters.png](images/cu-manage_submissions-submissions_filters.png)

**[MY WORKBENCH](my-workbench.html)** displays your submissions in a list view under the **SUBMISSIONS LIST** tab. From here, you can view your submission records, organized and sorted into three tabs by your most recently updated submissions, submissions assigned to you that constitute new business, and submissions assigned to you that constitute renewed business.

![cu-manage_submissions-submissions_list_highlighted.png](images/cu-manage_submissions-submissions_list_highlighted.png)

To view all of your organization's submissions in the Connected Underwriting P&C solution in a dashboard view, go to the **SUBMISSIONS** page.
