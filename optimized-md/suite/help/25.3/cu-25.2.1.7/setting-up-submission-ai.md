## Introduction

After [installing](install-submission-ai.html) the Submission AI module, you need to set it up before using it with your Connected Underwriting (CU) P&C Base application.

This guide walks you through the required incorporation steps in order, including:

-   [Exposing the Record Chat component on the Submission summary](#step-1-expose-the-record-chat-component).
-   [Adding the Refresh Summary record action the the Submission record](#step-2-add-the-refresh-summary-record-action-to-the-submission-record)

Before performing these incorporation steps, ensure that your system meets the [required prerequisites](#system-prerequisites)

### System Prerequisites

This section details the prerequisites your system must meet to run the InsureMO Excel Rater module.

-   Appian platform running version 25.2 or greater.
-   A supported version of [MariaDB](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.2/System_Requirements.html#databases) as a business data source.
    -   **Note**: Instructions below are for MariaDB databases. For use with other databases, the SQL script must be modified to fit syntax requirements.
-   A supported [web browser](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.2/System_Requirements.html#web-browsers).
-   **Connected Underwriting Base Application v1.7** imported.
-   **ISU Add-On: Submission AI (ISU\_SAI)** application imported and installed in the target environment.

## Step 1: Expose the Record Chat component

To allow users to engage with the AI chatbot in the context of the Submission record you need to expose the [Record Chat Component](../Records_Chat_Component.html) on the Submission record summary.

To update the Submission Summary interface:

1.  Login to the target environment.
2.  Navigate to the **Appian Designer**.
3.  Navigate to **Connected Underwriting (ISU)** application.
    1.  Search for and open the **ISU\_submissionRecordViewSummary** interface.
        1.  Add **ISU\_SAIC\_submissionRecordChatCard** above **ISU\_alertsList** by inserting the code block as shown:

            ![submission_summary_interface_updates](images/submission_summary_interface_updates.png)

            -   **Note**: Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code block:

                ```
                1
                2
                3
                4
                5
                6
                7
                8

                12
                13
                14
                  /*Submission AI Chat Pane*/
                 a!pane(
                   accessibilityText: 'translation!{56f2b585-c3d1-48fc-9589-dbacc1a5f545}ISU_SAI Translations.{3da0af57-b4a1-4dbe-b18d-02bf20bfd68f}AI Chat',
                   showWhen: local!showSubmissionAIChatPane,
                   width: "NARROW_PLUS",
                   padding: "LESS",
                   backgroundColor: local!brandingMap.Blue0Color,
                   contents: rule!ISU_SAI_Submission_DisplayChat(
                     brandingMap: local!brandingMap,
                     submission: ri!submission,
                     showWhenCollapseIcon: true,
                     collapseSaveTarget: local!showSubmissionAIChatPane
                   )
                 )
                ```

    2.  Click **SAVE**.

## Step 2: Add the Refresh Summary record action to the Submission record

1.  From **Appian Designer**, search for and open the **ISU\_Record\_Submission** record type.
    1.  Click the **Actions** tab.
        1.  Under the **Related Actions** section, click **Configure New Action Manually**.
            1.  Configure the **Refresh Summary** related action as shown:

                ![refresh_summary_related_action](images/refresh_summary_related_action.png)

                ![refresh_summary_related_action_context](images/refresh_summary_related_action_context.png)

            2.  For **Display Name**, use the `Refresh` translation string contained in the `ISU_SAI Translations` translation set.
            3.  Click **DONE**.
    2.  From the side menu, click the **Views and Actions Security** tab.
        1.  Click the **Actions** tab.

            ![submission_record_views_security_actions_tab](images/submission_record_views_security_actions_tab.png)

            1.  Locate the **Refresh** action you previously created.
                1.  Click the **Edit icon** to update the security of the record action.
                    1.  Configure the record security of this action as shown:

                        ![edit_action_refresh_dialog](images/edit_action_refresh_dialog.png)

    3.  Save the changes.
2.  Open the **ISU\_SAI\_Submission\_DisplaySummary** interface.
    1.  Locate the `sideBySideItem()` function containing `recordActionField()` around **line 177**, and reference the **Refresh** record action created in the previous steps, as shown:

        ![update_submission_display_summary_record_action](images/update_submission_display_summary_record_action.png)

3.  Save the changes.

## Step 3: Add AI Summary Section to Submission Summary

1.  From **Appian Designer**, search for and open the **ISU\_submissionRecordViewSummary** interface.
    1.  Below the call to the `ISU_bannerAlertsList` rule, insert a call to the `ISU_SAI_Submission_DisplaySummary` rule, as shown:

        ![submission_record_vew_summary_updates](images/submission_record_vew_summary_updates.png)

        -   **Note**: Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code block:

            ```
            1
            2
            3
            4
            5
            6
            7
             /*Submission AI Summary Section*/
                  rule!ISU_SAI_Submission_DisplaySummary(
                    brandingMap: local!brandingMap,
                    submission: ri!submission,
                    showWhenExpandChatLink: true,
                    expandChatSaveTarget: local!showSubmissionAIChatPane
                  )
            ```

## Step 4: Add the Update Summary node to the manual Create Submission process

1.  From **Appian Designer**, search for and open the **ISU Create New Submission** process model.
    1.  Directly before the **isEmailSupported?** XOR node, add a new asynchronous subprocess node called **AI Submission Summary**.

        ![ai_submission_summary_subprocess_node](images/ai_submission_summary_subprocess_node.png)

    2.  Under the Setup tab of the subprocess node, configure the node as shown:

        ![configure_ai_summary_subprocess](images/configure_ai_summary_subprocess.png)

2.  Save and publish the process model.

## Step 5: Add the Update Summary node to the Complete Submission Processing process

1.  From **Appian Designer**, search for and open the **ISU Complete Submission Processing** process model.
    1.  Directly before the **Dummy; for incorp - do not remove** script task node, add a new asynchronous subprocess node called **AI Submission Summary**‚Äù\*\* as shown:

        ![ai_submission_summary_subprocess02](images/ai_submission_summary_subprocess02.png)

        1.  Under the **Setup** tab of the subprocess node, configure the node as shown:

            ![configure_ai_submission_summary02](images/configure_ai_submission_summary02.png)

## Next steps

Now that you have set up the [Submission AI](cu-submission-ai-overview.html) module you can use it in your CU P&C solution to gain additional insights about the Submission record and reduce your processing time.
