## What does Appian Contract Writing provide?

### Guided data collection

A helpful form wizard guides you and your end users through an efficient data entry process for your contracts, which reduces time and helps ensure data accuracy in your contract documents.

### Configurable workflows and reviews

Create checklists, workflows, and reviews that will automatically assign tasks to groups or individuals based on the contract data. Our task management suite allows users to easily add, edit, rearrange, or reassign your tasks as needed.

### Full transparency with a single view

Combine disparate data from legacy processes, different sources, and checklists into a single application to enable collaboration within your organization. Break down barriers in your procurement process and clarify the status of your procurements through solicitation and award summaries, task visibility, and procurement progress indicators.

### Comprehensive document management

Create, manage, and collaborate on your contract documents and templates directly in the application. Capture key details, automate clause set creation, and take advantage of our rich text editor to craft your contract documents with ease.

### Generative AI capabilities

Boost your writing efficiency by leveraging AI to kickstart a draft or make quick updates to your contract text, all with you in control of the final output.

### Procurement AI Copilot

Easily navigate the complexities of government contract writing with your own personal knowledge assistant. The Procurement AI Copilot module integrates with Appian’s Contract Writing solutions to help streamline the procurement process. Quickly access relevant knowledge, increase compliance, and increase decision-making efficiency.

### Procurement Analytics integration

Contract Writing also integrates with [Procurement Analytics](procurement-analytics-module-overview-cw.html) to enable acquisition-related reporting, helping you get the most from your available award data. Common reports include Category Spend (against budget), Socioeconomic Spend (against budget), Fiscal Year Obligated Spend, Vendor Spend, PSC Spend, and reporting to show the current lifecycle status of all Awards.

See [Installing Procurement Analytics](installing-procurement-analytics-cw.html) to get started.

### Other Transaction Agreements (OTs)

Track and manage special contractual agreements between government agencies and non-traditional contractors known as OTs. Because these agreements have different rules and requirements than FAR-based contracts, they typically vary in structure from agency to agency and need to be managed differently than traditional government contracts. The Contract Writing solution, with its wide range of capabilities, allows you to create and manage OTs according to your organization's unique requirements with maximum flexibility and speed.

### Integration with Docusign

The Docusign integration in CW helps facilitate a faster and more efficient contract signing process in CW.

This integration allows you to leverage Docusign’s e-signature capabilities directly in your solution to request and authenticate digital signatures as a part of your contract workflows.

You can easily configure specific tasks and workflows for contract types, assign signatories, and define a signing order for a given contract.

The CW solution will automatically retrieve executed contracts from DocuSign and upload them to the contract record, providing a seamless and streamlined experience for contracting personnel.

The following Docusign capabilities are supported in this release:

-   Assign to Someone Else
-   Print & Sign: Upload

See the [Docusign Integration Setup Guide](docusign-integration-setup.html) for more information.

### Integration with Government Source Selection

Contract Writing (CW) comes with an integration with Government Source Selection (GSS) that allows data to flow between the two solutions, streamlining the process of creating an evaluation from a solicitation.

The Solicitation Summary view provides an entry point into GSS from CW, and the ability to create a new evaluation that is pre-populated with data from a solicitation reduces the need to rekey overlapping information in each solution.

As long as you have both solutions in the same environment, the integration will be set up automatically.

### Integration with Vendor Management

Contract Writing (CW) comes with an integration with Vendor Management (VM) that allows data to flow between the two solutions, streamlining the process of creating an opportunity from a released solicitation.

The Solicitation Summary view provides an entry point into VM from CW, and the ability to create a new opportunity in VM that is pre-populated with data from a released solicitation in CW reduces the need to rekey overlapping information in each solution. Solicitation-specific fields that originate from CW will be read-only in the VM opportunity record.

For more information on setting up this integration, see [Setting up VM Integration](setting-up-vm-integration.html).

### Integration with FPDS

Appian Contract Writing includes an integration with the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) that allows agencies to create Contract Action Reports (CAR) for Indefinite Delivery Vehicles (IDVs). This integration helps agencies to accurately and consistently capture and record key procurement data.

For more information, see [Setting up FPDS Integration](FPDS-integration-setup.html).

### Integration with GAM Acquisition Central

Appian Contract Writing includes an integration with GAM Acquisition Central that empowers your procurement professionals with the tools they need to manage the entire vendor lifecycle with greater confidence and efficiency, directly from their CW solution.

This integration provides access to:

-   **Centralized Vendor Records:** Contract Writing accesses vendor data directly from the GAM Acquisition Central Vendor Module. This means any vendor created or updated in the GAM Acquisition Central is immediately available for use in your CW solution.
-   **SAM.gov Data Utilization:** When you select a vendor in CW, the system can pull the latest verified information, including SAM.gov status and exclusions, directly from the GAM Acquisition Central's integration with SAM.gov. This ensures you are always working with up-to-date and compliant vendor data.
-   **Pre-populated Vendor Information:** During the creation of solicitations or awards, vendor-specific fields can be pre-populated with data from the GAM Acquisition Central's reference vendor records, minimizing manual input and potential errors.

For more information on setting up this integration, see [GAM Acquisition Central Integration Setup](GAM-acquisition-central-setup.html).

### Intelligent Code Search

Use efficient and intelligent capabilities to quickly find the data you need. Our intelligent code search easily identifies Product Service Codes (PSC) and recommends related NAICS codes to save you time.

## Contract Writing Navigation

The application consists of two main work spaces that are made up of two different sites: the **Contract Writing Site** and the **Contract Writing Settings Site**.

### Contract Writing Site

The [Contracting Writing](#contract-writing-site) site allows users to:

-   **Create, update, and amend a solicitation**: Enter in all the solicitation data needed through a guided experience. Use the intelligent search capabilities to find contacts, addresses, and Product Service Codes (PSC) and NAICS codes to reduce errors when creating new solicitations. Easily track and maintain all line item data and documents and create amendments for your solicitation.
-   **Create, update, and modify an award (contract)**: Use a guided experience to enter all the award data or manually create the award from your solicitation by copying the data to your award. Use the intelligent search capabilities for contact, addresses, and Product Service Codes (PSC) and NAICS codes to reduce errors when creating the award. Easily track and maintain all your award line item data and documents. Easily create modifications for your award.
-   **Create, configure, and complete checklist items**: Checklists are a collection of assignable tasks. Each checklist is completely configurable with the ability to add, edit, or sequence checklist tasks as needed. Users are notified by email when a new task is assigned and will also receive follow-up notifications when tasks are due, overdue, re-assigned to a new user or when the due date is modified.
-   **Maintain visibility into the state of solicitations and awards**: Our solution provides a centralized location to view all of your solicitation and award data, documents, status, and history. This includes both original and conformed documentation. Agencies can also grant view-only access to non-contracting department personnel to get insights into solicitation or award details, tasks, status, and progress to completion.

See [Contract Writing Quick Start Guide](quick-start-user-guide.html) for an overview of the most common views and actions you will use to manage your procurement workflows.

### Settings Site

The Contract Writing Settings site allows business users to manage solicitation and award checklists and review processes, including managing categories, tasks, and checklists.

From the front end of the application, the [Contract Writing Settings](settings-site.html) site allows business users to:

-   **Manage Categories**: Categories group checklist items together, usually by the function of the item or the group that performs the checklist items. Business users can update these categories as their needs change.
-   **Manage a library of tasks**: You can create a library of tasks that make it easy to add items to templates and individual requirement checklists.
-   **Keep checklists up to date**: Realizing that users are always marking a task as not needed? Remove the task. Have a new requirement checklist type? Create a new checklist. Your requirement checklists can be as flexible as you need them to be.
-   **Manage document and solicitation/award review processes**: Review process is a grouping of all the user groups that need to review the document, solicitation, or award. You can create a library of processes based on document template, threshold amounts, or solicitation method.
