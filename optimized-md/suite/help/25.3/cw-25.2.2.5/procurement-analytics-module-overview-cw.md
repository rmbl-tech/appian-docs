## Introduction

Procurement Analytics is the practice of analyzing procurement spending to decrease costs, increase efficiency, or improve supplier relationships. With your organization spending millions of dollars annually, tracking expenditures, planning future year budgets, and identifying potential opportunities for savings can be complicated and involve multiple systems, making your ability to identify those savings opportunities sometimes unobtainable.

Appian Procurement Analytics looks to simplify these efforts by providing a consolidated view of your spending, displaying valuable metrics and goals specific to your organization. By integrating with Contract Writing, Procurement Analytics will utilize available data related to the contract management process to highlight key spending metrics and provide mission-critical reports. The best news is that Procurement Analytics can be deployed immediately alongside your current Contract Writing instance.

## What does Appian Procurement Analytics provide?

### Guided dashboard setup wizard

The setup wizard allows you to select the data, charts, and metrics important to you and uses those selections to configure the dashboard to ensure the most critical information is being displayed. The wizard also provides the opportunity to define goals specific to your agency, using that information to provide real-time tracking in the dashboard over the fiscal year.
