Once a developer [prepares process data](prepare-data.html) by configuring record types in a development environment, it's time to deploy the application to the production environment, so your organization can access the production data in Process HQ.

When deploying to production, ensure your package contains the [case record type, event history, and any related record types](key-pi-terms.html#case-record-type-and-event-history-record-type) necessary for process analysis.

During direct deployment, all evaluations of a deployed record type will be attributed to the service account that deployed the package.

**Note:**  If you're deploying a [records-backed record type](records-backed-record-types.html), ensure the service account has the necessary [security](records-backed-record-types.html#configure-security) configured.
