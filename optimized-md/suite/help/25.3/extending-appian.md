Developers can extend Appian using plug-ins. You can find existing plug-ins on the [Appian AppMarket](https://community.appian.com/b/appmarket), or create your own. Read on to find out more.

## Types of plug-ins

As a developer you can create plug-ins that add new capabilities to the Appian platform. Each type of plug-in extends a specific part of Appian.

### Advanced plug-ins

[Advanced plug-ins](advanced-plug-ins.html) provide valuable functionality that you can use to extend and expand the capabilities of the platform. These plug-ins are available directly in the Admin Console.

### Integration SDK

The [Integration SDK](integration-sdk-overview.html) lets developers extend Appian's low-code integration capabilities. Whether you want to make it easy for designers to connect to backend data services using the guided experience of connected systems or you want to let users interact with another system directly from an Appian interface, the Integration SDK provides all the tools, documentation, and examples you'll need to succeed.

Integration SDK Plug-ins:

-   [Connected Systems](connected-system-plug-in-landing.html)

### UI SDK

The [UI SDK](component-plugins.html) lets developers design custom component plug-ins to extend the capabilities of Appian interfaces by adding new [components](SAIL_Components.html) that integrate with external systems directly from your user's browser or mobile device.

UI SDK Plug-ins:

-   [Components](component-plugins.html)

### Suite API

The Appian platform provides a suite of capabilities for managing processes, documents, users, groups, and more. The [Appian Suite API](Appian_Plug-ins.html) gives plug-ins access to use those capabilities in new ways, creating powerful new features for Appian applications.

Suite Plug-ins:

-   [Smart Services](Custom_Smart_Service_Plug-ins.html)
-   [Functions](Custom_Function_Plug-ins.html)
-   [Data Types](Custom_Data_Types_from_Java_Object.html)
-   [Servlets](Custom_Servlet_Plug-ins.html)

### Appian RPA

[Libraries](libraries.html) are custom code snippets you can use to integrate common operations into your robotic tasks.

## Plug-in support disclaimer

### Standard plug-ins

Standard, non-Appian supported plug-ins are not supported elements of the Appian Software or Cloud Offering. Plug-ins have not been subject to the full Appian software development lifecycle. Appian disclaims any obligation to maintain or update plug-ins and any warranties on their performance. All plug-ins are separate code from the Appian software and are to be used at customer's own risk. Any support provided by Appian with respect to plug-ins is on a voluntary basis. By installing a plug-in, the customer acknowledges and agrees to this disclaimer, and it shall control over any other agreement between customer and Appian.

Appian supports selected standard plug-ins. To the extent that a plug-in does not conform to its documentation, please submit a ticket to Appian Support. Appian does not support customer-created customizations.

### Advanced Plug-ins

Advanced Plug-ins are built by Appian to provide additional specialized functionality. We actively maintain and update these plug-ins, as well as support each plug-in’s latest version. While these plug-ins are not subject to Appian’s full software development lifecycle, Advanced Plug-ins are thoroughly tested during development, including for product security. To the extent that an Advanced Plug-in does not conform to its documentation, please submit a ticket to Appian Support. Appian does not support customer-created customizations to any plug-in, including Advanced Plug-ins.
