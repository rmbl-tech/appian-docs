The isNativeTablet() function has been deprecated, and will be removed in a future release of Appian. Instead, use the [a!isPageWidth()](fnc_scripting_a_isPageWidth.html) function to more easily optimize responsive UIs for tablet width or the [a!isNativeMobile()](fnc_scripting_a_isNativeMobile.html) function to conditionally change a component's behavior based on if the user is on the Appian Mobile application.
