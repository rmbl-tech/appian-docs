## Introduction

The Appian Government Clause Automation (GCA) solution is a customizable application built on Appianâ€™s low-code platform using expert knowledge and best practices for acquisition processes. This solution allows government agencies and federal civilian agencies to provide a guided automated experience for creating clause supplement documents. This allows organizations to efficiently select the correct clauses needed for their agency.

The application consists of a main workspace that is made up of the following site features:

-   The Government Clause Automation site allows all users to:
    -   **Create and update a clause set**: Enter contract details, select a template, and answer questions to get suggested clauses.
    -   **Fill-ins and edit**: Upload all the vendor and evaluation documents through a guided experience, and add fill-ins to clauses in a clause set.
    -   **Validate and finalize clause set**: Select configurable approaches when the evaluation is created or add configurable approaches when evaluation events occur. Add, edit, and rearrange those tasks as needed. Each evaluation approach is completely configurable.
    -   **Maintain visibility into status of clause set**: View all of the data for a clause set in one location. Allow your departments to see the status of the clause set.
-   The GCA site allows privileged users to:
    -   **Manage templates**: Use phases to group approach tasks together, usually by the function of the task or the group that performs the tasks. Business users can update these phases as their needs change.
    -   **Manage a library of questions**: Create a library of questions that make it easy to determine what clauses to add to a clause set.
    -   **Keep questionnaires up to date**: Realize that users are always missing a clause in their supplements? Add a question to the questionnaire to make sure it isn't missed. Remove the task. Have a new category of questions? Create a new category and questions in your questionnaire. Your questionnaire can be as flexible as you need them to be. GCA is designed to help you make a clause selection questionnaire set up process quick and easy.
    -   **Manage rules**: Create rules based on questionnaire questions and contract details to determine which clauses should be included or excluded in a clause set.
    -   **Manage clauses**: Manage and edit clauses in the clause bank. This includes making updates to clause properties and tagging fill-ins in the clause text.
