## Introduction

One of the main differentiators of Government Source Selection (GSS) is its ability to empower business users to manage their own requirement checklists without having to rely on their already overloaded IT departments.

Through the Source Selection Settings site, business users can:

-   [Manage phases](gss-configuring-phases.html) that group process tasks together.
-   [Manage tasks](gss-configuring-tasks.html) that can be chosen for evaluation processes.
-   [Manage approaches](gss-configuring-approaches.html) that assign default tasks for an evaluation.
-   [Manage document](gss-configuring-reviews.html) reviews that recommend configured custom document review processes when documents are submitted for review.

## Access the Source Selection Settings site

The Source Selection Settings is a separate site in the GSS application. Only business users in the `AS GSS Source Selection Settings Site Access` group have access to the site, which ensures that specific users who need it have access to sensitive processes.

To access the Source Selection Settings site:

1.  Click on the **Government Source Selection (GSS)** home page to list the options.
2.  Select **Source Selection Settings** to navigate to the **Source Selection Settings** site.
