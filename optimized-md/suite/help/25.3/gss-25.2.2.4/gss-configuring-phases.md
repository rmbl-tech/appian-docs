## Introduction

After you access the [Government Source Selection Settings site](gss-accessing-settings-site.html), you can view the Phases page.

A phase is a distinct stage in the process of evaluating vendor proposals. These phases organize the evaluation process into manageable segments, ensuring a thorough, systematic, and transparent review of proposals against the requirements and criteria outlined in the solicitation. Each phase includes specific objectives, activities, and deliverables.

Phases group [tasks](gss-configuring-tasks.html) together, usually by the function of the tasks or the group that performs the tasks. We have provided some phases out of the box that are completely configurable to meet the needs of your organization's source selection approach.

This page describes how to configure the phases needed to create your organization's approaches.

## View phases

You can view the Phases page in two ways:

-   From the **Welcome to Source Selection Settings** page, click **PHASES**.
-   From the left navigation menu, click **Phases**.
