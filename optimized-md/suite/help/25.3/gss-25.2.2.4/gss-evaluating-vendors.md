## Introduction

Using Source Selection, evaluators can access everything they need from a single place. They can find their assigned tasks, view vendor documents, and complete their ratings. The solution environment facilitates secure evaluation data transfer. Evaluators can see only the evaluations that are assigned to them. Data that the evaluator uploads or submits is viewed only by the contracting office and the evaluator.

After contracting personnel [starts an evaluation](gss-creating-new-evaluation.html#review-and-start-evaluation), evaluators rate vendor submissions based on the assigned [evaluation factors](gss-creating-new-evaluation.html#add-factors). The permissions granted to an evaluator enable them to view only the information that is relevant to them and their role.

## Evaluate vendors

To complete a vendor evaluation, an evaluator must review the vendor’s submission documents, add responses, and submit a rating:

1.  Go to the **My Workspace** tab.
2.  Select an evaluation card in the **Active Evaluations** section to navigate to its summary.

    **Note:**  Each card represents an active evaluation assigned to the evaluator. It identifies the team name and individual evaluators. Evaluators check the progress bar to see their task completion percentage.

    Alternatively:

    1.  Scroll down to the **Tasks** grid to see all your assigned tasks.
    2.  Select a task of the type `Complete Evaluation` to navigate to the **Evaluation** page.
    3.  Skip to step 4.

3.  Expand a factor in the **Factors** section to see its tasks and subfactors.
    -   Select **Assigned to me** using the **ASSIGNEE** dropdown to filter your assigned tasks in the **Factor Tasks** section.
    -   Click a subfactor in the **Subfactors** section to view the subfactor tasks.
4.  Select a task to navigate to the **Evaluation** page.

5.  Click a document in the **Vendor Documents** section to download and review the vendor submission document.
6.  Click **ADD RESPONSE** in the **Responses** section to open the response form.
7.  Select **Section** using the dropdown. Out-of-the-box values are `Significant Strength`, `Strength`, `Significant Weakness`, `Weakness`, and `Deficiency`.
8.  Enter **Response** and its **Justification**.
9.  Enter **References** to sections in the vendor response document.
10.  Click **SAVE** to add the vendor response, or click **SAVE AND ADD ANOTHER** to add more vendor responses.
11.  Scroll down to the **Final Rating** section.
12.  Select a rating. [Rating methods](gss-creating-new-evaluation.html#add-factors) are pre-configured during the evaluation creation process.
13.  Enter **Rating Justification**.
14.  Click **UPLOAD** to browse and upload supporting evaluation documents.
15.  Click **SAVE AS DRAFT** to save the rating as a draft and work on it later.
16.  Click **SUBMIT** to submit the vendor rating. This action completes the task and removes it from the task list.

## Delete vendor responses

To delete an evaluation response:

## On-the-spot consensus

Enabling on-the-spot consensus during [evaluation creation](gss-creating-new-evaluation.html#create-evaluations) skips individual evaluator tasks. The factor chair can submit the consensus report directly. See [On-the-spot consensus](gss-creating-new-consensus.html#on-the-spot-consensus) for more information.

## Select LPTA vendors

**Note:**  This section applies to [LPTA evaluations](gss-creating-new-evaluation.html#create-lpta-evaluations) where vendor selection is required, but vendor evaluation and rating are not.

After starting an [LPTA evaluation](gss-creating-new-evaluation.html#create-lpta-evaluations), the evaluator is assigned a task to select a vendor to complete the evaluation.

To select an LPTA vendor:

1.  From the evaluation **Summary** tab → **Evaluation Tasks**, click **LPTA Evaluation Task** to navigate to the **LPTA Evaluation** page.

    ![Select LPTA evaluation task from grid.](images/select_lpta_vendors.png)

2.  Review the vendor pricing details and documents.

    ![LPTA evaluation screen with vendor pricing and documents.](images/select_lpta_vendors_2.png)

3.  In the **Vendor Decision** section:

    1.  Select a **Decision** option: **Select** or **Reject**.
    2.  Enter the **Reason** for your decision.

        If you select **Select**:

        -   Click **SUBMIT** to finalize the vendor selection and complete the task.

            ![LPTA vendor decision form: Select vendor with reason.](images/select_lpta_vendors_3.png)

        If you select **Reject**:

        -   Click **NEXT** to navigate to the next vendor’s **LPTA Evaluation** page to review their submission details and make a decision to either **Select** or **Reject**.
        -   Alternatively, click **SAVE AND CLOSE** to save progress and return later.

            ![LPTA vendor decision: Reject vendor with reason.](images/select_lpta_vendors_4.png)

        **Note:**  The decision for a rejected vendor cannot be changed. Click **BACK** to see the rejected vendor’s details.
