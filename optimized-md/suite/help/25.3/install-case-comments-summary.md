## Introduction

The [Case Comments Summary](cms-case-comments-summary-overview.html) module ships as a separate module supported on Case Management Studio. Once installation and setup are complete, this module uses AI to generate a summary of case comments, allowing case workers to quickly read a summary of case comments, so that they donâ€™t have to read every single comment to understand what has happened in the case.

This guide outlines the steps for downloading and installing the Case Comments Summary module before incorporating it with your Appian Case Management Studio Base application. The steps include:

1.  [Downloading the software package](#step-1-downloading-the-software-package).
2.  [Creating database objects](#step-2-creating-database-objects).
3.  [Importing the application](#step-3-importing-the-application).

Before starting the installation process, review the [System Requirements](#system-requirements) to make sure all minimum requirements are met.
