Extending Appian with the Integration SDK

Watch this interactive webinar as Appian experts walk you through everything you need to start creating plug-ins for low-code developers.

The Integration SDK provides developers with a way to extend Appian's low-code integration capabilities through **Connected System Plug-ins**.

Regardless of your role, the SDK provides great benefits:

-   **For vendors:** Create branded, low-code integrations to your platform and ship them with your logo in the Appian AppMarket.
-   **For partners:** Deliver Appian solutions that feature compelling user interfaces and integrations that are easier for developers to modify and extend.
-   **For teams:** Handle complex design challenges to deliver on unique customer requirements.

## Connected system plug-ins

Appian comes with [many connected systems](Connected_System_Object.html) that make it easy to integrate with enterprise systems and services using a tailored point-and-click design experience. The Integration SDK gives developers the ability to bring that same low-code experience to backend integrations with additional platforms.

For more information, see [Connected System Plug-ins](connected-system-plug-in-landing.html).
