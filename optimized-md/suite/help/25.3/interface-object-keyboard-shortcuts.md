Adept developers can leverage several keyboard shortcuts to build interfaces more fluidly. There are general keyboard shortcuts that can be used for overall interface design, as well as keyboard shortcuts that enhance functionality specific to either design mode or expression mode.

## General shortcuts

The following keyboard shortcuts can be used in both design mode and expression mode:

-   Toggle between design mode and expression mode (Ctrl+M for Windows and Mac)
-   Add new rule input (Ctrl+I for Windows, Cmd+I for Mac)
-   Test interface (Ctrl+Enter for Windows, Cmd+Enter for Mac)
-   Undo (Ctrl+Z for Windows, Cmd+Z for Mac)
-   Redo (Ctrl+Shift+Z for Windows, Cmd+Shift+Z for Mac)

**Note:**  Undo/Redo in design mode will undo/redo changes to last interface state; in expression mode, this action will only undo/redo changes to text within the interface definition. Therefore, Undo/Redo can only be used to undo/redo changes within the same mode. For example, you cannot undo an action taken in expression mode by using the Undo function in design mode.

The following keyboard shortcuts are for component-level actions in design mode:

-   Duplicate the selected component (Ctrl+D for Windows, Cmd+D for Mac)
-   Delete the selected component (Ctrl+Del for Windows, Cmd+Del for Mac)

The following keyboard shortcuts are available when interacting with the expression editor in an interface:
