Welcome to Interfaces Documentation!

Everything you need to know about interfaces can be found right here. Use these set of topics to help you build amazing interfaces in Appian.

## Browsing these topics

The interface topics are organized into four main categories so that you can easily find information based on your goals.

### Learn

In this category you will find conceptual topics about interfaces and how to think about them in your Appian environment. Don't know what SAIL is? You can read all about it [here](SAIL_Design.html).

### Build

This category is all about creating interfaces and you'll find how-to's, tutorials, and examples. Be sure to check out [Interface Recipes](SAIL_Recipes.html), which contain a huge number of design patterns and solutions that cover everything from validating inputs to advanced grids.

### Best practices

You'll find best practices or guidance on building interfaces that are [well-designed](sail/home.html) and [accessible](building_accessible_applications.html) in this category.

### Reference

Forget how to edit your Interface properties? You can look up detailed information or questions about the [Interface object](interface_object.html) or [components](SAIL_Components.html) in this category.
