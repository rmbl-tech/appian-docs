## Introduction

The Appian Connected Onboarding solution combines all of the best qualities of the financial service onboarding solutions of yesteryear. It is flexible, fast to market, and fully customizable for your organization's unique processes. What if you had one solution to handle all of the tasks you used to rely on email and spreadsheets for? What if that solution was ready to deploy in weeks?

Whatever your onboarding process has been, you are here nowâ€”the documentation for the Appian Connected Onboarding solution. Things are about to get a lot better.

This page provides a quick overview of all the ways Appian Connected Onboarding has to offer. If you would like to know more about how to use the Connected Onboarding solution, check out the topics in Using Connected Onboarding starting with the [Home Page Overview](home-page-overview.html).

## Simplify, accelerate, and modernize onboarding

Your ability to wow customers during the onboarding process creates value throughout your relationship with the customer. First impressions are key to building trust and peace of mind that they have chosen the right company to work with.

However, onboarding can be slowed by lack of coordination, poor visibility, and an inability to adapt to quickly changing business strategies and regulations. Commercial, off-the-shelf solutions and manual processes that rely on spreadsheets and emails are too rigid and slow to respond to this dynamic environment.

**_What if you could surprise and delight customers throughout the onboarding process?_**

Built on the Appian low-code platform, Connected Onboarding offers adaptability, extensibility, and speed-to-market. You can fast-track onboarding with a solution that can be configured to your own unique, complex environment.

## What does Appian Connected Onboarding provide?

### Customizable process templates

Create workflow templates that will automatically assign tasks based on key data entered during the initial onboarding. These workflow templates use a guided experience to walk you through configuring the required documents, tasks, products, and accounts needed for all your workflows all from one central location. Notice a task that is always being reassigned or marked not needed? Update the template so end users don't have to manually update it each time.

Have a large amount of accounts to onboard? Use our template bulk management workflows to manage bulk actions like cloning, deleting, importing, and updating templates for these accounts.

### Complete control over tasks

Create, configure, and complete onboarding tasks in one easy-to-use solution. Customizable onboarding processes automatically assign tasks based on the type of onboarding. Then add, edit, rearrange, and reassign those tasks as needed.

### Automated efficiency

With Connected Onboarding, you'll receive:

-   OFAC integration to automatically verify customers through the [Consolidated Screening List API](https://developer.trade.gov/api-details#api=consolidated-screening-list&operation=search) from Trade.Gov.
-   Connectors to many of the industry's leading data providers.
-   Document classification using Appian's Intelligent Document Management (IDP).
-   Framework for using Appian's Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to complete tasks in other systems.

### Full transparency for a single view of the customer

Onboardings are hugely complex processes, where many parts of the organization have to work together to make your customers happy. Connected Onboarding uses the power of Appian Records and Appian data fabric to combine data from your legacy processes, systems, and checklists together into a single platform, all while keeping your data right where it is. Break down barriers and clarify the status of onboardings through client summaries, visibility of tasks, and milestone progress.

### Document management for fewer errors

Connected Onboarding allows you to upload, manage, and track the status of documents related to your onboardings. You can verify information in certain documents and track required documents directly in a customized document approval flow. Appian's Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) will automatically classify your documents in order to ensure that the correct documents are being reviewed.
