## Overview

Installing and running Appian on Kubernetes requires a variety of artifacts, including Helm charts, container images, and binaries. This page details how to download and install them.

## Generate temporary registry credentials

Temporary credentials for Appian's container registry can be generated from the [SUPPORT page](https://forum.appian.com/suite/sites/myappian/page/support) of the MyAppian site on Appian Community:

1.  Click **DOWNLOADS > PLATFORM > LOW-CODE PLATFORM**.
2.  Select **Appian 25.3**.
3.  Underneath Installers in the Downloads pane, click **Show Kubernetes Files > Generate Container Registry Credentials**.
4.  Select the region nearest your geographic location.
5.  Copy the generated temporary registry login password.

## Appian operator Helm chart

The Appian operator Helm chart can be pulled from Appian's container registry.

**Note:**  You must be running Helm v3.8.0 or greater to pull the chart. You can check what version of Helm you have by running the following command:

```
1
helm version
```

### Login to the registry

To login to the container registry to pull Helm charts, run

```
1
helm registry login --username AWS --password <PASSWORD> 937620572175.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com
```

where `<REGION>` is the region you selected and `<PASSWORD>` is the password you generated in [Generate temporary registry credentials](#generate-temporary-registry-credentials).

### Pull the Helm chart

To pull the Helm chart from the container registry, run

```
1
helm pull oci://937620572175.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/helm-charts/appian-operator --version <APPIAN_OPERATOR_VERSION>
```

where `<REGION>` is the region you selected in [Generate temporary registry credentials](#generate-temporary-registry-credentials) and `<APPIAN_OPERATOR_VERSION>` is the version of the Appian operator.

## Appian operator and Appian images

The Appian operator and Appian images can be pulled from Appian's container registry.

**Note:**  You must be running Docker Engine 20.10 or greater to pull the images. You can check what version of Docker Engine you have by running the following command:

```
1
docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'
```

### Login to the registry

To login to the container registry to pull images, run

```
1
docker login --username AWS --password <PASSWORD> 937620572175.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com
```

where `<REGION>` is the region you selected and `<PASSWORD>` is the password you generated in [Generate temporary registry credentials](#generate-temporary-registry-credentials).

### Pull the images

To pull an image from the container registry, run

```
1
docker pull 937620572175.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/appian/<COMPONENT>:<COMPONENT_VERSION>
```

where `<REGION>` is the region you selected in [Generate temporary registry credentials](#generate-temporary-registry-credentials) and `<COMPONENT>` and `<COMPONENT_VERSION>` are the component - and version of the component - of the image you wish to pull. Valid components are `appian-operator`, `zookeeper`, `kafka`, `search-server`, `data-server`, `service-manager`, `webapp`, `httpd`, and `rpa`.

### Push the images to your registry

You'll need to push the images to your organization's container registry. For each image, run

```
1
2
3
docker tag \
  937620572175.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/appian/<COMPONENT>:<COMPONENT_VERSION> \
  <REGISTRY_HOSTNAME>/appian/<COMPONENT>:<COMPONENT_VERSION>
```

and

```
1
docker push <REGISTRY_HOSTNAME>/appian/<COMPONENT>:<COMPONENT_VERSION>
```

where `<REGION>` is the region you selected in [Generate temporary registry credentials](#generate-temporary-registry-credentials), `<REGISTRY_HOSTNAME>` is the hostname of your organization's registry, and `<COMPONENT>` and `<COMPONENT_VERSION>` are the component - and version of the component - of the image you wish to push.

**Note:**  Pushing the images to your organization's registry is only necessary if installing and running Appian on Kubernetes in a remote cluster (i.e. not Docker Desktop, minikube, etc).

## Migration Tool

The binaries for the [Migration Tool](migration-tool.html) can be downloaded from the [SUPPORT page](https://forum.appian.com/suite/sites/myappian/page/support) of the MyAppian site on Appian Community:

1.  Click **DOWNLOADS > PLATFORM > LOW-CODE PLATFORM**.
2.  Select **Appian 25.3**.
3.  Underneath Installers in the Downloads pane, click **Show Kubernetes Files**.
4.  Select the file(s) named `migrate-<OPERATING_SYSTEM>-<ARCHITECTURE>-<APPIAN_OPERATOR_VERSION>[.exe]` for the operating system(s) and architecture(s) where you'll be running the Migration Tool and proceed to download the file(s).

**Note:**  Downloading the Migration Tool is only necessary if migrating a server-based installation of Appian into Kubernetes.
