## Overview

This page describes how self-managed customers can set up their own self-signed CA certificates on the webhooks used by Appian on Kubernetes. Note that the recommended and simplest option of configuring certificates is through using [cert-manager](install-appian-on-k8s.html#1-install-the-appian-operator)

The Appian operator includes webhooks for the following purposes:

-   Enforce custom defaults: [mutating admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook).
-   Validate incoming requests: [validating admission webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#validatingadmissionwebhook).
-   Perform conversions between different versions of the CRD: [conversion webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/#webhook-conversion).

The webhooks require passing in an external CA certificate. Our example below provides details on how to create a self-signed certificate using our preferred option cert-manager. Alternatively, a self-signed certificate can be generated manually and provided directly into the `caBundle` field.

## Using cert-manager

Do the following steps to install and utilize cert-manager to store and inject the certificates into the Appian operator.

1.  [Install cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).

2.  Create an Issuer in the `appian-operator` namespace. Create a yaml file with the following contents:

    ```
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
     apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
     kind: Issuer
     metadata:
       name: appian-operator-webhooks-selfsigned
       namespace: appian-operator
     spec:
       selfSigned: {}
    ```

3.  Apply the issuer file.

    ```
    1
    kubectl apply -f <PATH TO ISSUER .YAML FILE>
    ```

4.  Create a certificate in the `appian-operator` namespace using the Issuer created in the previous step. Note that we specify a secret name of `appian-operator-webhooks-certificate`. We will use that secret name in the next step. Also note the DNS name of the Issuer. Create another yaml file with the following contents:

    ```
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
    11
    12
     apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
     kind: Certificate
     metadata:
       name: appian-operator-webhooks
       namespace: appian-operator
     spec:
       issuerRef:
         kind: Issuer
         name: appian-operator-webhooks-selfsigned
       dnsNames:
         - appian-operator-webhooks.appian-operator.svc
       secretName: appian-operator-webhooks-certificate
    ```

5.  Apply the certificate file.

    ```
    1
    kubectl apply -f <PATH TO CERTIFICATE .YAML FILE>
    ```

6.  Proceed to [Helm installation](install-appian-on-k8s.html#1-install-the-appian-operator).

## Configure `caBundle` field directly

As an alternative to cert-manager you can use a self-signed certificate for `appian-operator-webhooks.<namespace>.svc`. Add your CA bundle to `webhooks.caBundle` when you run `helm install` or `helm upgrade` using `--set` or `--values` options.

For this example we will use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate a self-signed certificate.

1.  Make a self-signed certificate valid for `appian-operator-webhooks.appian-operator.svc`.

    ```
    1
    2
    3
     mkcert -cert-file appian-operator-webhooks.crt \
       -key-file appian-operator-webhooks.key \
       appian-operator-webhooks.appian-operator.svc
    ```

2.  Create a Kubernetes secret in the `appian-operator` namespace containing the public certificate and the private key generated in the previous step.

    ```
    1
    2
    3
    4
     kubectl create secret tls -n appian-operator \
       appian-operator-webhooks-certificate \
       --cert appian-operator-webhooks.crt \
       --key appian-operator-webhooks.key
    ```

3.  Install the Appian operator Helm chart. Make sure to specify the appropriate values to set the webhooksâ€™ secret to the secret created in the previous step. If you changed the secret name in the previous step, use that name here instead of `appian-operator-webhooks-certificate`. We will also specify the content of the client CA bundle for the webhooks using the Base64 encoded content of the certificate generated in the previous step.

    ```
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
     helm --namespace appian-operator install appian-operator appian-operator-<APPIAN_OPERATOR_VERSION>.tgz \
       --set image.repository=<REGISTRY_HOSTNAME>/appian/appian-operator:<APPIAN_OPERATOR_VERSION> \
       --set webhooks.secret=appian-operator-webhooks-certificate \
       --set webhooks.caBundle="$(cat appian-operator-webhooks.crt | base64 --wrap=0)" \
       --wait
    ```

    Append to the above any additional Helm options you would use.
