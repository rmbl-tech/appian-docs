## Overview

This page shows how to set up inbound and outbound email in Appian on Kubernetes for self-managed customers.

## Email Configuration

Appian does not include an email server for inbound/outbound email, but it can be configured to [send and receive email](../Mail_Server_Setup.html) via external email servers by properties set in `custom.properties` and `passwords.properties`. Appian on Kubernetes supports specifying these properties in the [.spec.customProperties](crds.html#v1beta1appianspec) and [.spec.webapp.passwordsPropertiesSecretName](crds.html#v1beta1webapp) fields, respectively, on Appian custom resources. The latter field represents the name of a Kubernetes [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

To configure Appian to send and receive email, do the following.

1.  Create a file on your machine named `passwords.properties` with the appropriate content as instructed by the [product documentation](../Mail_Server_Setup.html).

2.  Create a Secret containing `passwords.properties` using the following command.

    ```
    1
    kubectl -n <NAMESPACE> create secret generic passwords-properties --from-file=passwords.properties
    ```

3.  Set the `.spec.customProperties` and `.spec.webapp.passwordsPropertiesSecretName` fields on your siteâ€™s Appian custom resource:
