## Introduction

The Connected KYC Home page is the primary page to complete tasks and track Investigations. It is an invaluable tool to track Investigations at a high level and to identify issues.

Connected KYC offers two distinct views:

1.  **Manager View**: Focuses on the overarching status of everything going on. ![manager_home_page.png](images/manager_home_page.png)

2.  **Case Worker View**: Focuses on the individual's task and investigations. ![home_page_KYC.jpg](images/home_page_KYC.jpg)

Each view has different metrics and data to help specific users manage their work.

## Active Alerts

The **Active Alerts** section displays any alerts that are currently open for any customer. An alert shows information about when and why it was triggered. The user can dismiss the alert from this page. For more information about configuring alert conditions, see [Configure Alerts](configure-alerts.html).
