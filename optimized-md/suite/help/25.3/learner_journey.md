## Your learning journey

Appian provides a wealth of resources to get you started and support you throughout your journey. The table below describes the different resources available to you.

### Available resources

| [Community](https://community.appian.com/) | The Appian Community acts as an information hub for Appian’s supporting resources as well as providing a valuable one of its own: Forums.

## Appian learning stages

We’ve identified four main stages the typical developer goes through on their journey with Appian and the ideal resources to leverage during each one. Keep in mind that everyone’s journey is unique, so the time spent in each stage may vary.

### Beginner

At this stage, you should be in learning mode and taking courses in Appian Academy. You can attend a classroom course to jump start your journey with an expert instructor who can guide you through content and answer your questions. Or, you can choose a personal, self-paced learning journey with Academy Online, where you’ll find video-based courses conducted by those same expert instructors.

| Time Frame | Focus | Primary Resources | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2-4 Weeks | Learn the Basics |
-   [Academy Classroom and Onsite](https://community.appian.com/training/)
-   [Academy Online](https://academy.appian.com/)

 |

### Intermediate

As you start to apply your skills, you’ll want to continue expanding your knowledge of Appian by taking more advanced training courses, as well as exploring the docs. A lot of basic design patterns can be found in the [Interface Recipes](SAIL_Recipes.html) and [Function Recipes](Function_Recipes.html). What’s great about these recipes is you can copy-and-paste them into Appian to see how they work. You should begin to ask questions of the Community and seek feedback on different ways to approach solutions.

| Time Frame | Focus | Primary Resources | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2-6 Months | Grow & Explore |
-   [Documentation](Appian_Documentation.html)
-   [Academy Online](https://academy.appian.com/)

 |

-   [Interface Recipes](SAIL_Recipes.html)

 |

### Practitioner

As your understanding of Appian continues to evolve, so will your contribution to projects. You should consult Appian MAX regularly for best practices to help ensure your applications are scalable and maintainable. You should also branch out more in the Appian Community by contributing your own knowledge, design patterns, and solutions. You will likely find that the time you spend with instructional docs shifts more to reference docs, and you should continue to use Academy Online as new courses become available that are tailored to helping you reach even further. Reference the Knowledge Base as needed for support queries.

| Time Frame | Focus | Primary Resources | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6-18 Months | Evolve & Contribute |
-   [Appian Max](https://community.appian.com/success)
-   [Support & Knowledge Base](https://community.appian.com/support/w/kb/)
-   [Documentation](Appian_Documentation.html)

 |

-   [Appian Functions](Appian_Functions.html)
-   [Design Object](design-objects.html)
-   [Interface Components](SAIL_Components.html)
-   [Process Notes and Smart Services](Smart_Services.html)

 |

### Expert

By this point, you should be a regular contributor to [Community Discussions](https://community.appian.com/discussions/). Your time spent with the various resources is a lot lower in this phase because your strong foundation of product knowledge lets you consume new content quickly. While most of the courses in Academy Online aren’t designed for your level of experience, you want to keep your expert status by staying up-to-date on the latest features through course highlights, updates, as well as the Community YouTube channel. Knowing what’s available will also make you a valuable resource to colleagues just starting their journeys.

| Time Frame | Focus | Primary Resources | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over 18 months | Lead & Optimize |
