In today's exceedingly connected world, it can be easy to forget that having access to the internet isn't always possible. However, Appian knows that many organizations face this struggle daily. Whether it is performing an inspection in a remote location or checking in at an off-the-grid site, we know how important it can be for users to retain a seamless Appian experience, even when offline.

Offline mobile allows some of the most powerful functionality in Appian, whether the user is online or not. Powerful features such as task reports, cascading dropdown lists, wizards, conditional content, and validations are all possible with offline mobile.

Users get their work done while disconnected using [offline forms](how-offline-mobile-works.html#the-building-blocks-of-offline-forms), which are offline-enabled interfaces set up as site actions or tasks. There are some very important design considerations you need to be aware of in order to ensure these offline experiences work as expected.

This documentation helps you design offline experiences by explaining:
