Everything You Want to Know about Appian Private AI

What is private AI, and how does it work? In this video, Appian Director of Architecture Mark Talbot breaks down the basics of private AI, explains how it functions, and answers common questions from customers.

## Overview

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can revolutionize how you do business. But with data as the foundation, AI and ML are exciting prospects that must be carefully planned, implemented, and used: especially if you plan to use AI with proprietary or protected information.

This page describes **private AI**: Appian's approach to protecting your data during model creation, training, and use. You'll find details on private AI's advantages over public AI tools, and how we build features with private AI in mind.

With Appian's private AI, we:

-   Never share your data outside of the [Appian Cloud compliance boundary](https://appian.com/support/resources/trust/security.html).
-   Never train our own models on your data, or share your models with other customers.
-   Ensure data always remains in your control.

## Public AI vs. Private AI

Appian wants you to embrace AI knowing that your data is protected during every step of design, implementation, and use. The best and most secure way to integrate AI into your processes is through private AI.

Learn more about private AI's advantages over public AI:

| Â  | Private AI | Public AI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data sharing | Your data is never shared outside of Appian's Cloud compliance boundary. | Your data is in the hands of the public AI model owners, and may be used at their discretion. |
| Model training and sharing | Your data is only used to train your models and those models are never shared. | Your data may be used to train other models, including those for competitors. |
| Data control | Your data always remains within your control. | Once your data is shared, you can't always know how it will be used or who will see it. |
