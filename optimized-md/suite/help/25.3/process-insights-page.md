This page applies to [data stewards](processhq.html#-data-stewards) and [business users](processhq.html#-business-users). It describes what actions are available on the **Process Insights** page of Process HQ.

## Overview

The **Process Insights** page allows you to quickly access business processes, so you can [explore](explore.html) process data, [drill down on Process HQ's analysis of that data](investigate.html), and [collaborate with your colleagues](collaborate-on-insight.html) on the insights you build.

To access this page, select **Process HQ** from the navigation menu in the Appian header bar, then click **Process Insights** in the left navigation bar.

## Search for a process

To search for a process, enter the name or description of the process in the search box.

## Refresh the process list

Refreshing the process list causes the latest status to display for each process.

When you add a process, edit a process, or update a process, it can take some time for Process Insights to analyze the process data. You can refresh the process in the process list to determine if the analysis has completed.

To refresh the process list, click the refresh button next to the search box.

## Open in a new tab

In the **PROCESSES** list, click the more menu for the process, then select **Open in New Tab**.
