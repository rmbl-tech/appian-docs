This page applies to [business users](processhq.html#-business-users). It describes what actions are available in a view of a process in Process HQ.

## Overview

In Process HQ, a [view](process-views.html) is a subset of cases that is defined by a set of filters. By default, the **All Cases** view is available for all processes. You can also create custom views to focus on specific types of cases.

On this page, you can [explore](explore.html) the cases related to the view, [create KPIs](process-custom-kpis.html) to help you look more closely at specific characteristics of the cases, then [start drilling down](investigate.html) to insights.

To access this page, go to the [process page](process-page.html), and click any view in either the **PINNED VIEWS** section or the **All Views** tab.

## Elements

The following image highlights the elements that make up a process view:

**EXPLORE DATA FOR THIS VIEW** section

 |

Switch between the following tabs to explore view data in the selected time period:

-   **Process Diagram**: See the [process diagram](explore.html#review-the-process-diagram).

    From the diagram on this page, you can [view details](explore.html#view-process-part-details) for individual activities or sequences, as well [start drilling down](investigate.html#start-with-the-process-diagram) on a specific process part.

-   **Case Attributes**: See [attributes](explore.html#review-case-attributes) of cases associated with the process.

    From this tab, you can [view attribute value details](explore.html#view-attribute-value-details), but you cannot drill down to insights for a specific attribute value. To drill down on an attribute value, go to the [**Case Attributes** tab](investigate.html#start-with-a-case-attribute) in a KPI page instead.

-   **Case List**: See the [list of cases](explore.html#review-the-case-list) associated with this process.

-   **Conformance and Costs**: Define the [expected activity order](process-views.html#define-the-expected-activity-order) and [activity costs](process-views.html#define-activity-costs), so you can [review conformance and costs](explore.html#review-conformance-and-costs).

-   **All KPIs**: See the list of [KPIs](process-custom-kpis.html) configured for this view, and [start drilling down](investigate.html) to build an insight.

-   **All Insights**: See the list of [insights](collaborate-on-insight.html) related to KPIs in this view.
