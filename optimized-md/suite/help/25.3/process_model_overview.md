Welcome to Process Modeling Documentation!

Everything you need to know about process models can be found right here. Use these set of topics to help you build efficient processes in Appian.

## Browsing these Topics

The process model topics are organized into four main categories so that you can easily find information based on your goals.

### Learn

In this category you will find conceptual topics about process models and how to think about them in your Appian environment. If you aren't familiar with BPMN, check out [Process Modeling with Appian](process_modeling.html).

### Build

This category is all about creating process models and you'll find how-to's, tutorials, and examples. Be sure to check out [Process Modeling Tutorial](Process_Modeling_Tutorial.html), which will walk you through creating your first process.

### Best Practice

You'll find best practices and guidance on building and managing your process models. There is also a handy page about [testing your process models](Testing_and_Debugging_Problems_with_Process_Models.html) in this category.

### Reference

Forget how to edit your Process Model properties? You can look up detailed information or questions about the [process model object](process-model-object.html) or [nodes and smart services](Smart_Services.html) in this category.
