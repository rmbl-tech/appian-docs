## Introduction

[ProcureSight Core](https://procuresight.com) is a standalone data service that leverages Appian AI, data fabric, and semantic search to allow your organization to efficiently search, retrieve, and process public procurement data sets from sources like [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov) and [SAM.gov](https://www.SAM.gov). It is designed for US Federal government procurement employees, including:

PS streamlines procurement research by integrating public datasets with an easy-to-use search function. Once the data is retrieved, PS organizes and centralizes the data into readable and actionable records displayed in one unified view. Quickly access past solicitations and awards so you can find and reuse previous contracts, gain valuable insights from integrated data, identify best vendors for particular goods and services, and create solicitations that are compliant with strict regulations required for government procurement.

Additionally, you can utilize PS to track timelines, contract values, small business awards, competition, best-in-class vehicles, and selected vendors. Organize your research by creating and managing collections of relevant procurements.
