## Introduction

The service that your organization uses for searching past procurements, maintaining research for one or more procurement collections, identifying vendors who provide the required products and services, and learning about critical past procurement evaluations can either speed up or slow down your procurement process.

Suppose you need to know which requirements were included in the statement of work documents for past cybersecurity service purchases, the vendors offering these services, and the completion timeline of contracts associated with these purchases. Current public data services run by the government, such as [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov/), [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/), and agencies’ legacy procurement systems, provide subpar search interfaces and results. Even when data is discovered, it frequently lacks the necessary completeness and contextual information to make it truly valuable, resulting in an unnecessarily inefficient and frustrating procurement process. This is because the current structure uses a data warehouse model of accumulating years of data but doesn’t provide users with effective searching capabilities. You need a tool that can help you find this information quickly, allowing you to write better statements of work and performance work statements and improving your ability to categorize purchases, evaluate proposals, and research and evaluate vendors. The right data service can do all of this and more, driving better outcomes, saving time, and reducing costs.

**_What if you could quickly and efficiently find past procurements to help you accelerate your new purchase?_**

Using a research and discovery use case, this overview explains ProcureSight Core's key features and benefits and how it can help streamline and accelerate your procurement processes.

## A research and discovery use case

In today's digitally connected world, organizations rely increasingly on efficient data collection services to streamline their procurement processes. For example, David, a Contract Specialist for the National Surveillance and Intelligence Bureau (NSIB), needs to draft a Statement of Work (SOW) for a new cybersecurity services contract. He needs to ensure the SOW is comprehensive and reflects current best practices, but NSIB has limited examples of similar recent procurements. David logs into his free PS account and uses the AI-powered semantic search to find past procurements for cybersecurity incident response services.

Within seconds, PS returns the results of all created and completed cybersecurity services solicitations from other agencies for the past five years. In addition, PS shows the associated awards for these solicitations in a centralized view, giving David a quick synopsis of results, including a similarity percentage. All related documentation for the solicitation is attached to the search result.

David scans the search results and finds a solicitation with the SOW and RFI documents attached in PDF format. He opens the solicitation to engage with AI Copilot to gain insights about specific procurement requirements, evaluation criteria, and other important details within the attached PDFs. Within a few minutes of finding several solicitations that matched his needs, David was able to create a collection of results to prepare for future procurements and exported them to save as evidence of market research to share with his director.

## What does ProcureSight Core Offer?

Now that you understand the use case for PSps\_plus\_bulk\_vendor\_import, let’s dig into some of its key features and benefits.

### Seamless data collection and integration

PS search results include more than just [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov/) opportunities. By incorporating information about contracts issued, PS eliminates the need for David to search multiple sites to find related award data. The goal of the service is to allow him to search generated records to find the complete historical procurement data he needs to create new procurements and any required documentation. David can also use this data to generate market reports that speed decision-making in his agency's procurement process and provide timely notifications via emails and alerts.

### Semantic search technology

A search on [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov/) often yields results that are completely unrelated to the procurement at hand. Users resort to tweaking search terms, hoping to find even a handful of relevant procurements. PS leverages semantic search technology that transforms this experience by promptly returning numerous results closely aligned with the original search, even when expressed differently. The semantic similarity ensures automatic relevance, marking a distinctive shift in user engagement with our more sophisticated solution.

### Collections

Procurement teams often lack the time to manually connect and analyze data from multiple procurements to identify common patterns, trends, and insights. ProcureSight Core’s Collections feature solves this problem by providing a way for David to group similar or related procurements to extract valuable insights or store them for future use. With Collections, David can swiftly access information on procurement timelines, average contract values, small business awards, competition types, best-in-class vehicle usage, and specific vendors selected.

As new procurements and documents are added to ProcureSight Core's data sets, David can refine their search results at any point and add the results to an existing collection.

### Chat with documents

SAM opportunities contain a wealth of unstructured data, including solicitation documents, statements of work, requests for information, and performance work statements. Reading through these documents to find specific details needed to aid your procurement process is like searching for a needle in a haystack. PS includes an AI Copilot integration that allows David to engage with an AI chatbot to gain insights into PDF documents attached to a search result. The chatbot acts as a knowledge assistant, allowing him to obtain the critical procurement information they need without the cost of reading lengthy documents.

### Document creation

Procurement teams that rely on manual research and data collection methods to gather the information they need to create documents for new procurements face many challenges. Manual processes are time-consuming and error-prone, making it difficult to create high-quality documents that meet regulatory requirements and compliance standards. PS simplifies document creation by allowing David to search its data source for existing procurement documents that can be used as a reference to create new ones.
