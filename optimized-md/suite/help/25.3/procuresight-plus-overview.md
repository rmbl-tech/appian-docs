## Introduction

The service your organization uses for searching past procurements, sharing research, and ensuring policy alignment can either accelerate or stall your entire procurement process. For a contracting manager, this challenge is magnified. You need to ensure your team can research effectively, collaborate seamlessly, and produce work that is both consistent and compliant with ever-changing agency regulations.

Suppose your team is tasked with several complex procurements while a new agency-wide policy is being rolled out. Your specialists are duplicating research for similar requirements, and you lack an efficient way to ensure their final documents adhere to the new mandate or even existing agency-specific rules. Information is scattered across legacy systems and public data sites like SAM.gov, making it difficult to centralize best practices or create a single source of truth. This siloed approach leads to wasted time, inconsistent requirements documents, and a constant risk of non-compliance. You need a tool that not only finds information quickly but also unites your team's efforts and automates compliance.

**_What if you could empower your entire team with a single platform that unifies their research, automates policy checks, and accelerates the creation of high-quality, compliant documents?_**

This overview explains key features and benefits of ProcureSight Plus (PS+) and how it can streamline your procurement processes through a use case that illustrates how PS+ can drive efficiency and streamline collaboration and compliance across a team.

## Streamlining collaboration and ensuring compliance use case

Abraham, a Contracting Manager for the National Surveillance and Intelligence Bureau (NSIB), manages a team of five contract specialists and is currently facing two major challenges in his team's workflow: inefficiency and compliance. During a recent task audit, he found that his team often duplicates market research for similar procurements, leading to wasted time and inconsistent contract language and terminology. Compounding this issue, NSIB has just implemented a new, complex policy for all cloud service acquisitions. Abraham needs to ensure every new requirement document is compliant while his team continues to correctly apply all other existing agency-specific regulations.

Fortunately, NSIB recently adopted ProcureSight Plus, giving Abraham and his entire team a shared, collaborative environment through a simple Single Sign-On (SSO) process. To combat redundant work, Abraham champions the use of shared research collections. Now, when he is assigned a new cloud procurement, he can immediately access the team's _Cloud Services_ collection, leveraging the research his colleagues have already compiled instead of starting from scratch.

When it comes to ensuring compliance, the AI-powered chat feature is a game-changer. A junior Contracting Officer on Abraham's team, unsure about the new mandate, can ask the AI-powered chat, _What are the new data residency requirements for Cloud services?_ and get an immediate, accurate response. This same tool can help him clarify existing regulations, such as the documentation requirements for a sole-source justification.

Once the collaborative research is done and the policy questions answered, Abraham's team can utilize the AI Document Builder that's integrated with their Requirements Management solution to generate a draft SOW. The AI not only pulls from best-in-class examples but also ensures the new document is automatically formatted to agency templates and incorporates the specific cloud policy requirements.

## What does ProcureSight Plus Offer?

Now that you understand the use case for ProcureSight Plus, letâ€™s dig into some of its key features and benefits.

### Advanced research experience

The central workflow in PS+ is designed to take you from a broad query to specific, actionable insights in a seamless and intuitive manner.

#### Unified search and discovery

Abraham's PS+ journey begins on the **Home** page, with a clean dashboard that includes an integrated search feature, allowing him to search across three distinct data types: **Procurements**, **Vendors**, and **Protests**. This centralized search capability eliminates the need to visit multiple government websites, providing a single point of entry for all initial research questions. From **Home**, Abraham will have quick access to recent searches and quick actions to accelerate his procurement research process.

#### Deep-dive analysis

Drilling down into a search result opens a comprehensive **Summary** page. This view aggregates all relevant information, including synopsis details, dates, set-asides, and PSC/NAICS codes. You can review detailed protest and award data. A key part of the PS+ experience is the ability to pivot seamlessly from a procurement to the vendors involved. Accessing the View Vendor Details provides you with a complete profile of the vendor so you can analyze their past performance and history.

### AI-powered insights and interactions

PS+ includes a suite of integrated AI tools that transform static data into a dynamic, interactive research environment.

#### Leveraging the AI Copilot

SAM opportunities contain a wealth of unstructured data. Reading through all this data to find the specific details you need to aid your procurement process is like searching for a needle in a haystack. PS+ significantly enhances the platform's AI capabilities with an AI Copilot integration that allows Abraham to engage with an AI chatbot to gain insights into PDF documents attached to search results. The chatbot acts as a knowledge assistant, allowing him to obtain the critical procurement information they need without the cost of reading lengthy documents. Ask questions in natural language instead of manually reviewing lengthy documents like SOWs or technical specifications. For example, one can ask, _Summarize the security requirements._ or _What are the specified deliverables in Section C?_ The AI chatbot provides relevant excerpts and summaries, saving time and ensuring important details are identified.

#### The Acquisition Toolbox

The PS+ Acquisition toolbox contains specialized AI-powered tools, including FAR Chat, the PSC/NAICS Code Explorer, and Alerts to help streamline and accelerate research and data collection, and simplify communication.

#### Engaging with FAR Chat

Chat with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) documents and public supplemental and policy documents to gain valuable insights and accelerate decision-making. FAR Chat is a powerful compliance tool that provides instant clarifications and interpretations of complex regulations, mitigating risk and accelerating decision-making. ProcureSight even provides sample prompts to guide and get Abraham started.

#### Finding PSC/NAICS codes

The PSC/NAICS Code Explorer leverages AI to help Abraham and his team identify the correct Product Service Codes and North American Industry Classification System codes based on a simple description of goods or services. This tool helps them ensure their procurements are categorized correctly from the start.

![ps_plus_code_explorer](images/procuresight-plus/ps_plus_code_explorer.png)

It also grants Abraham access to Appian's newest advanced AI and intelligent agent capabilities for even more sophisticated analysis.

#### Accelerating document creation and integration

A key differentiator of PS+ is the AI Document Builder, which assists in drafting and generating content for new solicitations using intelligent assistance and reusable templates. Since Abraham's agency also has Appian's Requirements Management (RM) solution, they have integrated PS+ data services seamlessly with RM, unifying their systems to enable AI-powered workflows and AI assistance for document creation directly within RM.

### Organizing and operationalizing research

Research is only valuable if it can be saved, organized, and acted upon. PS+ provides robust features for managing your findings.

#### Creating collections

Additionally, PS+ enables Abraham to save search results to a Collection, organizing his research findings beyond simple bookmarking. Collections solve the problem of dispersed and unorganized research data. Instead of having disparate search results, Abraham can consolidate his findings into thematic collections.

![ps_plus_saved_collection](images/procuresight-plus/ps_plus_saved_collection.png)

Furthermore, Collections leverage AI to analyze the contents of a collection to automatically identify similarities across procurements, enhancing the value of the collections by proactively revealing key insights and relationships that might not be immediately obvious through manual review. This facilitates more efficient and insightful procurement research and analysis, providing an at-a-glance understanding of the saved data, saving time and effort in manually identifying patterns and connections.

#### Using alerts and bulk actions

PS+ allows Abraham to set up email alerts to stay informed about vendors and opportunities. Vendor alerts provide notifications on vendor status changes, while Opportunity alerts notify him when new solicitations matching specific criteria are posted to [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov/). He can enable alerts directly from the **Quick Actions** panel or a vendor's profile to stay informed.

![ps_plus_create_opp_alerts](images/procuresight-plus/ps_plus_create_opp_alerts.png)

For larger-scale analysis, the **Bulk Vendor Import** feature allows him to add a list of vendors to a collection to generate reports and enable alerts.

#### Streamlining access and reporting

For enterprise-wide deployment, Single Sign-On (SSO) simplifies the login experience and enhances security. Finally, ProcureSight Plus offers unlimited vendor reporting, removing data thresholds to allow for the most comprehensive vendor vetting and market research possible.
