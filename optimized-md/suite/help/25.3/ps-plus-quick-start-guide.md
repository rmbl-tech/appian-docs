## Searching procurement data

From the **Home** page, you can enter keywords in the **Search** field to find existing procurements that match specific criteria and click Search.

![ps_search_box_with_search_term1b.](images/procuresight-plus/ps_search_box_with_search_term1b.png)

By default, PS+ returns the top 50 search results and displays them in card view, separating each procurement into an individual card.

### Initiating a previous search

To retrieve the latest results for one of your last three searches, click the link associated with the previous search under **Previously searched**.

![ps_search_box_with_search_term_history](images/procuresight-plus/ps_search_box_with_search_term_history.png)

## Analyzing search results

PS+ makes it easy to analyze your search results by providing sort and filter options that allow you to narrow the search results down to only the procurements you want to see.

### Sorting search results

By default, results are sorted and ranked by their Similarity to your search term, from highest to lowest similarity percentage.

![ps_sort_search_results_1b](images/procuresight-plus/ps_sort_search_results_1b.png)

You can also sort the search results by posted date, and PS+ displays the results from the latest to the earliest post date.

![ps_sort_search_results](images/procuresight-plus/ps_sort_search_results.png)

### Filtering search results

PS+ offers several filters to help you narrow your search results to match the procurements that fit your process needs. You can filter by government agency, procurement type, procurements with related awards or attached documents, fiscal year, or procurements posted within a custom date range.

![ps_agency_pt_filters](images/procuresight-plus/ps_agency_pt_filters.png)

### Accessing the Summary view

With PS+, you can quickly access more details about a procurement result by clicking its title and opening the Summary view.

![ps_procurement_summary_view](images/procuresight-plus/ps_procurement_summary_view.png)

The Summary view includes the procurement type, post date, PSC and NAICS codes, place of performance, a procurement description, and any related documents attached to the procurement.

From here, you can also click **ADD TO COLLECTION** to add the procurement record to an existing collection. You can add a procurement result to an existing collection from the search results page. Simply click the icon associated with the procurement result and search for the collection you want to add it to. Note that search results can only be associated with one collection at a time.

### Leveraging AI Copilot

PS+ also comes with an AI Copilot integration that allows you to gain additional insights into a search result with the attached PDF documents. Once in the procurement's Summary view, click **Ask AI Copilot** to get started.

![ps_ask_ai_copilot](images/procuresight-plus/ps_ask_ai_copilot.png)

Next, select the PDF document you want to gain insight into and ask a question about it in the prompt.

## Managing Collections

Group your procurement research by collections that are easy to view and manage on the **Collections** page.

![ps_collections_page](images/procuresight-plus/ps_collections_page.png)

This page displays a list of all your collections and the number of procurements in each. Collections are ordered by timestamp from earliest to oldest.

### Creating a new collection

You can only add search results to existing collections. To create a new collection from the Collections page, click **CREATE**.

![ps_create_new_collection](images/procuresight-plus/ps_create_new_collection.png)

The Create Collection dialog opens. Enter the name and description for your new collection, then click **CREATE**.

Your new collection is displayed in the Collections list.

### Modifying existing collections

PS+ also allows you to update an existing collection and delete a collection that is no longer in use.

## Managing documents

PS+ simplifies document management and creation by enabling you to quickly search, reference, and leverage existing procurement documents to help create new ones.

### Viewing your documents

From the **Documents** tab, you can easily view and access all of your procurement documents.

![ps_documents_tab](images/procuresight-plus/ps_documents_tab.png)

The **My Documents** tab lists all procurements documents you created using a reference document in the application. The **Reference tab** lists all procurement documents you tagged with a document type.

![ps_document_tabs_ref](images/procuresight-plus/ps_document_tabs_ref.png)

### Adding a document reference

Did you find an existing procurement with related documentation that meets your needs? PS+ allows you to tag the document with a document type reference, which saves it for future use.

![ps_documents_add_reference](images/procuresight-plus/ps_documents_add_reference.png)

To add a document type reference to a procurement document:

        ![ps_document_type_dropdown](images/procuresight-plus/ps_document_type_dropdown.png)

### Creating a new document

After saving a reference document, you can use it to create a new procurement document.

![ps_create_document_action](images/procuresight-plus/ps_create_document_action.png)
