## Introduction

One of the main differentiators of Appian Requirement Management (RM) is its ability to empower business users to manage their own requirement checklists without having to rely on their already overloaded IT departments.

Business users use the Requirement Management Settings site to:

-   [Configure categories](configuring-categories.html) that group tasks together.
-   [Configure tasks](configuring-tasks.html) that can be chosen for requirement checklists.
-   [Configure requirement checklists](configuring-checklists.html) that assign default tasks for a type of requirement.
-   [Configure requirement review processes](configuring-review-processes.html) that automatically assign review trees for types of requirements.
-   [Configure requirement checklist recommendations](configuring-checklist-recommendations.html) to set what checklists are automatically recommended for new requirements.
-   [Configure questionnaires](rm-configuring-questionnaires.html) to customize questions for capturing organization-specific information.
-   Configure contract folders to organize and manage your contract files.
-   Configure message templates to use as a starting point for repetitive or routine communications.

## Access the Requirement Management Settings site

The Requirements Management Settings is a separate site in the RM application. Only business users with the `AS RM Requirements Management Settings Site Access` group membership are enabled to access it. This ensures that only a select few have the access to sensitive processes and information.

To access the Requirements Management Settings site:

1.  Click the **Requirements Management** dropdown in the top navigation bar, then select **Requirements Management Settings** to open the settings page.

    ![Select 'Requirements Management Settings' from the RM dropdown menu.](images/access_the_requirements_management_settings_site.png)

2.  Use the side navigation bar to navigate the **Requirements Management Settings** page.
