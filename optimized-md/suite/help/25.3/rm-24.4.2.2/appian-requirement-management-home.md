## Introduction

The application your organization uses to create and manage requirements packages is essential in successfully managing the requirements processes in your acquisition management lifecycle. Commercial, off-the-shelf solutions can be hard to implement because they require you to tailor your processes to the product so it can address your business needs.

**_What if you could quickly and efficiently create and execute requirement packages in a simple-to-use application without having to overhaul your entire process?_**

The Appian Requirements Management (RM) solution, built on the Appian Low-Code platform, streamlines acquisition requirement processes. It enables collaboration among teams and provides a comprehensive view of the requirement process, enhancing visibility and tracking progress within a single application. Its flexible and configurable design enables you to deploy the solution immediately or customize it to fit your brand identity and process needs. Best of all, RM delivers improved outcomes, saves time, and reduces errors in weeks.

## What does Requirements Management provide?

The Appian Requirements Management solution provides a wide range of features that allow your organization to collaborate, update, and execute their acquisition requirements. This table describes the solution's key features that differentiate it from other commercial solutions.

## RM use case: Expediting a critical IT software requirement

To better understand these key features in action, let us examine a detailed use case:

The National Surveillance and Intelligence Bureau (NSIB) faces constant evolving cybersecurity threats, necessitating rapid acquisition of advanced software. David, a cybersecurity analyst within NSIB and a requestor, identifies a critical need for specialized threat intelligence software to counter a new, emerging threat. The traditional acquisition process is known for being lengthy, often delaying crucial defense initiatives.

In this next section, let us explore the RM features that help David and his colleagues accelerate the procurement process through this example workflow.

### Facilitates speed and accuracy

The RM solution accelerates data collection and ensures a high level of accuracy and completeness during the submission creation process. For example, David can quickly add a new requirement for _Urgent Threat Intelligence Software_ using the **guided data collection** wizard. This wizard guides him to enter all the necessary requirement data.

As part of the requirement details, David utilizes the solution's **intelligent classification codes**. This allows him to quickly find and select the appropriate PSC (Product Service Codes) and NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) codes for the cybersecurity software, improving the overall requirement classification and aiding in identifying relevant best-in-class contracts for future procurement.

### Automates key processes

Upon creation of the requirement, the RM solution automatically recommends a configured checklist, _Critical Software Acquisition Checklist_, based on the inputs David entered. This **configurable checklists and tasks** feature automatically assigns various tasks to different groups and assignees based on the data entered by the requestor, such as an initial and an automated task for the requestor manager to approve.

To support the request, David uploads the technical specifications and a draft license agreement directly to the requirement. The **intelligent document management and creation** capabilities allow him to create, upload, and manage these documents efficiently within the application. The RM solution also has built-in SharePoint integration for seamless document collaboration.

Recognizing the urgency, David communicates with legal, using the RM solution's integrated messaging feature to attach the draft license agreement and request an expedited review. The **configurable requirement review process** automatically assigns review tasks to user groups, such as the legal team. Legal receives the task, quickly provides their review and approval, and the requestor confirms the completion within the solution.

### Provides transparency and reporting

RM consolidates all relevant data, documents, tasks, communications, and progress for the threat intelligence software requirement into **a single, accessible, centralized view**. This provides real-time visibility for the requestor manager and all stakeholders, fostering cross-functional collaboration and accountability.

Furthermore, RM offers **user-friendly reports** that allow NSIB's contracting managers and stakeholders to monitor progress, track task completion rates, and manage the team's workloads effectively. This helps identify bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.

### Integrates with powerful tools

Requirements Management (RM) users with an agency-wide subscription to ProcureSight [Enterprise](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.2/pspd-25.2.1.1/procuresight-enterprise-landing-page.html) or [Plus](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.3/procuresight-plus-landing-page.html) can **search procurement** **data** from public sources like [SAM.gov](http://SAM.gov) and [USAspending.gov](http://USAspending.gov) to identify similar threat intelligence software, **chat with procurement documents**, and **reference past procurements**. Since NSIB has a ProcureSight Enterprise subscription with their RM solution, these capabilities significantly speed up David's market research and helps him quickly identify suitable vendors.

![ProcureSight search interface for procurement data, including past searches & collections.](images/integrates_with_powerful_tools.png)

Once the requirement is approved, users with an Requirements Management and Contract Writing (CW) integration see the direct transfer of all relevant requirement data to their CW solution. This occurs for requirements with a status of _Accepted_ or higher in the RM solution. This **accelerates** **the creation of solicitations and awards** in the CW solution, **eliminating the need to manually re-enter data**. The threat intelligence software requirement includes a link to the associated solicitation or award, which in turn links back to the requirement.

If both solutions use the same environment, the RM and CW integration setup is automatic.

![Contract Writing UI showing a solicitation with linked, accepted requirement details.](images/integrates_with_powerful_tools_2.png)

RM also **supports an integration with the Award Management (AM) solution** that enables users to see the direct transfer of all relevant requirement data to their AM solution for requirements with a status of _Accepted_ or higher in their RM solution. This integration supports the **creation of awards directly from accepted requirements**, maintaining a cohesive link throughout the entire acquisition lifecycle from initial need to final award.

Threat intelligence software requirements includes a link to the solicitation or award, which in turn links back to the requirement. This creates a seamless connection between the two throughout the entire procurement acquisitions process.

If both solutions use the same environment, the RM and AM integration setup is automatic.

### Leverages AI

With the Procurement AI Copilot module in RM, NSIB can interact with requirements and process documents, gain instant insights, ask questions, and even generate summaries.

For example, David can ask the AI chatbot specific questions about past procurements from his search results, thereby further accelerating his decision-making capabilities. Additionally, the contracting manager can access the Analytics **Dashboard** to monitor and analyze previous interactions with AI Copilot to quickly access institutional knowledge.

The **Document Database** allows the contracting manager to access all of the documents that AI Copilot used to generate summaries and question responses.

### Ensures compliance

RM provides security features that allow NSIB to de-risk their deployment through the entire implementation lifecycle, ensuring the scalability, reliability, and security their customers need. With RM, they can rapidly adapt to specific requirement processes and maintain an auditable trail throughout the critical procurement process.

### Integration and efficiency in RM

This walkthrough of key RM features demonstrates how NSIB drastically reduced their procurement process time, enabling the rapid acquisition of critical threat intelligence software to enhance their cyber defense capabilities.
