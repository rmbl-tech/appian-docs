## Introduction

Access the [Requirement Management Settings](accessing-rm-settings.html#access-the-requirement-management-settings-site) site to view the Categories page. Categories group [tasks](configuring-tasks.html) together, usually by the function of the items or the group that performs the items. Following are some out-of-the-box categories that are completely configurable to meet the needs of your organization's requirement process.

-   `Planning`
-   `Requirements Definition`
-   `Pre-Solicitation`
-   `Solicitation`
-   `Award`

This page describes how to configure the categories needed to create your organization's checklists.

## Update categories

You can change the names of the out-of-the-box categories or any newly created categories.

3.  Update the category **Name**.
4.  Click **UPDATE** to update the category.

The new name is displayed in all new and existing tasks that reference it.

## Delete categories

To delete a category:

1.  Expand **Task Management** and select the **Categories** option to navigate to the **Categories** page.
2.  Click Vertical Ellipsis icon corresponding to a category and select **Delete** to open the **Delete Category** wizard.
3.  Click **DELETE** to delete the category.
