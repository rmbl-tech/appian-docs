## Introduction

The Requirement Management (RM) Home page is the primary page that users and managers use to complete tasks and track requirements. For other users, it is their home for keeping on top of their requirement work. For managers, it is an invaluable tool to keep track of requirements at a high level and identify issues.

The Home page displays different information depending on the user. This page provides an overview of the Home page and describes the display differences each user sees.
