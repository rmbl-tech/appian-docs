## Introduction

After installing Requirement Management (RM), you may need to migrate data from your organization's systems into RM. This process is generally very unique and has nuances that depend on many factors.

This page provides general guidelines to help you migrate data for your activity address codes (AAC) which are also known as DoDAAC.

## Migrate activity address codes

To migrate data to the activity address code tables:

1.  Import the data into the `AS_RM_R_ACTIVITY_ADDRESS_CODE` table.
2.  Import the data into the `AS_RM_R_ACTIVITY_ADDRESS_CODE_ADDRESS` table.

See [Activity Address Code reference data tables](reference-data-tables.html#activity-address-code-reference-data-tables) section.
