## Introduction

The Appian Requirements Management (RM) solution is a customizable application built on the Appian Low-Code Automation Platform using expert knowledge and best practices for acquisition processes. This solution allows government agencies and federal civilian agencies to provide a guided automated experience for creating a requirement package, allowing organizations to complete packages in a timely efficient manner.

The application consists of two main work spaces that are made up of two different sites:

-   The [Requirements Management](#requirements-management-site) site allows users to:
    -   **Create and update a requirement**: Enter in all the requirement data needed through a guided experience or copy an existing requirement to create a new one. Use RM's intelligent search capabilities for Product Service Codes (PSC) and NAICS codes to reduce errors when creating new requirements. Easily track PSC and NAICS codes for each requirement and use them to identify relevant Best in Class contracts.
    -   **Create, configure, and complete requirement tasks**: Each requirement checklist is completely configurable, including the criteria you want to determine the checklist recommendations your users see when creating a new requirement. Add, edit, and rearrange those tasks as needed. When a new task is assigned to a user, they receive an email notification in response to the event. They also receive an email notification when a task is due, overdue, reassigned to another user, or when the task due date changes.
    -   **Maintain visibility into the state of requirements**: View all of the data for a requirement in one location. Allow your departments to see the status of the requirement, visibility of tasks, and requirement progress.
-   The [Requirements Management Settings site](#requirements-management-settings-site) allows business users to:
    -   **Manage categories**: Categories group tasks together, usually by the function of the item or the group that performs the tasks. Business users can update these categories as their needs change.
    -   **Manage a library of tasks**: Making a requirement checklist set up quick and easy is what we are all about. You can create a library of tasks that make it easy to add them to templates and individual requirement checklists.
    -   **Keep checklists up to date**: Users frequently marking a task as not needed? Remove the task. Introducing a new requirement checklist type? Create a new checklist. Need to suggest relevant checklists? Recommend checklists based on specific requirement attributes. Your requirement checklists adapt to your needs.
    -   **Manage requirement review processes**: Requirement review process is a grouping of all the user groups that need to review the requirement. You can create a library of processes based on requirement type, category and threshold amount.
    -   **Manage questionnaires**: Need to collect organization-specific information for a requirement? Create grouped questions to add custom fields.

## Requirements Management site

### Home page

When you sign in to the RM site, the **HOME** page displays. This page contains several features that help business users get a quick view of information that is pertinent to them:

1.  **My Requirements** tab: Current requirements assigned to current user.
2.  **My Tasks** tab: Current tasks assigned to current user.
3.  Requirements' metrics: Key metrics for requirements assigned to current users.
4.  **ADD** button: Shortcut to add a new requirement.

Note that managers and general users have a slightly different home page view. We want general users to focus on their tasks, so they only see the requirements and tasks that are assigned to them or their team. They also do not see the bar charts.

Additionally, the top of the page contains tabs to the records for:

-   **REQUIREMENTS**
-   **MESSAGES**
-   **DIRECTORY**
-   **REPORTS**
-   **PROCURESIGHT**
-   **COPILOT**

### Record lists

Clicking any tab on the top of the page takes you to the associated record list to:

1.  Search and filter the record list.
2.  View a short summary of information about the records.
3.  Click a name to open the associated record summary view.
4.  Export the record list to Excel, clear filters, and refresh the record.

## Requirements Management Settings site

The Requirements Management Settings site enables business users to configure task categories, requirement checklists, review processes, checklist recommendations, questionnaires, contract folders and message templates to streamline RM. See [Accessing Requirement Management Settings Site](accessing-rm-settings.html).
