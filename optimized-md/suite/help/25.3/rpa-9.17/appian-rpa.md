## Welcome

Welcome to the Appian RPA Documentation!

This documentation provides the technical framework to help you design, develop, and deploy robotic tasks for your organization. Everything you need to know about Appian RPA can be found here.

| **Category** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **[WHAT'S NEW](whats-new.html)** | Check out the latest updates to Appian RPA! |
| **[LEARN](new-to-rpa.html)** | This category is where you can find detailed information about Appian RPA, its components, and how it works. If you are new to Appian RPA, this is a good place to start. |
| **[BUILD](build-rpa.html)** | Are you ready to plan, create, configure, and execute a robotic task? The Build category includes all of the steps you need for building robotic tasks. |
| **[MANAGE](manage-rpa.html)** | If you need to manage robots, report on exceptions or utilization, or generally monitor things in Appian RPA, the Manage category has the information you need. |
| **[TROUBLESHOOT](troubleshoot.html)** | You can find steps for debugging and troubleshooting robotic tasks as well as some frequently asked questions in this category. |
| **[SYSTEM ADMIN](sysadmin-rpa.html)** | If you are an Appian RPA administrator whose responsibilities are similar to that of a network administrator, you can find useful information about system requirements and topics like hybrid configuration in this category. |

## Who is this guide for?

This documentation serves as the reference guide for Appian RPA administrators and developers. The tasks and responsibilities for each role are as follows:

-   **Administrator**: Technical support in the organization for hardware and software infrastructure and communications. In addition, this role can change permissions and has remote access to the robots and the events generated by the platform.
-   **Developer**: This role corresponds to the designer, who analyzes and builds robotic tasks. The developer creates, sets up, and visually defines the workflow for the robotic tasks. Developers are responsible for preparing robotic tasks for deployment to other environments.
-   **Manager**: Operational support to help keep robotic tasks functional. Managers are responsible for executing robotic tasks, managing exceptions, and troubleshooting issues such as offline agents. Managers can't edit or create a robotic tasks, but help support existing ones.

Many other people play important roles in RPA. Individuals may step in at certain points in the process and help to resolve exceptions when they arise. As you plan and coordinate robotic tasks, it's also important to communicate with employees of the organization who know the processes best suited for automation. Users may need to know at a functional level what robots do, and they must handle detailed information about input and output data from the robotic tasks and their metrics. Further, some people must know the costs of both the manual process and the automation in order to calculate savings and determine the return on investment (ROI).
