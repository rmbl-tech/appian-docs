A robotic task is a series of actions that are executed by a robot. This page describes how to create a robotic task in Appian RPA by duplicating an existing robotic task design object.

**Required role:** [Developer or Administrator](learn-user-settings.html#rpa-roles)

1.  In the [list of design objects](../objects-view.html), mark the checkbox next to the robotic task you want to duplicate.

3.  Edit the name for the copied robotic task.

    **Tip:**  By default, the **Name** field contains the name of the robotic task you're duplicating. The robotic task name must be unique. Spaces are not supported, so consider using underscores to separate words. It is a best practice to preface the name with the application specific prefix.

4.  Change the **Description** as needed.
5.  Click **OK**.

    **Result**: The copied robotic task configuration displays.
