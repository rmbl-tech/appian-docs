## Overview

You'll see many lists in the Appian RPA console: robotic tasks, executions, robots, libraries, and repositories, just to name a few. Some of these lists contain valuable information and can be quite long.

To help you use this information outside of the console, you can filter the lists to show information you're interested in. Then, you can export the list to access the information in your chosen file format.

Export icons appear at the bottom of most lists, along with pagination options:

## Filter a list

To filter a list:

1.  Go to the list you're interested in.
2.  Type a search term in the **Filter** field.
3.  Press **Enter**. The list shows entries with matching results.

## Export a list

1.  Go to the list you're interested in and apply any filters you'd like.
2.  At the bottom of the list, click one of the two icons: **Copy to clipboard** and **Export to CSV**.
3.  If you choose to export a CSV file, it will download to your computer.

**Tip:**  Some lists include additional download options, such as **Export to Excel**. If you select this option, you're brought to the **Download reports** page of the **Statistics** menu, where the reports are stored for later access. You can download or delete the report from the **Download reports** page.

## Create a view

You can set up views for preset filters on the lists you usually work with. Each user can create views according to their needs. Appian RPA remembers the last selected view for each user and list.

To add a view:

1.  Go to the list where you want to create a view.
2.  Next to the list title, click the additional options icon.
3.  Click **Add**.
4.  Type a name for the view.
5.  Enter the regular expression to use. By default, the checkbox **Use simple expression** is marked. If unchecked, you can use regular expressions for more complex filtering matching the pattern you specify.
6.  Click **OK** to save the view. The new view appears as an option next to the default view (**All**).
