## Introduction

With the SAIL Design System you can create beautiful, functional interfaces quickly and easily.

The SAIL Design System consists of:

-   Appian's UI framework, called SAIL.
-   The design guidance and patterns provided on this site.

**Tip:**  **Using Figma to mock up your interface designs?** While mocking up SAIL UIs directly in Appian will always be the most efficient way to iterate on your designs, teams already using Figma can also leverage the [Appian SAIL Component Library](https://www.figma.com/@appian).

## SAIL UI framework

The SAIL UI framework consists of two major building blocks:

-   **Reusable components and layouts** - These can be assembled to build dynamic interfaces for your applications.
-   **Expression language** - Expressions stitch together the UI components with data and logic to create powerful applications.

Components make the interface, and expressions make the interface work.
