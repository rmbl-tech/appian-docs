## Optional setup steps

The setup steps in this section are optional, allowing you to adjust the prompt for Case Record Chat prompt to return responses that adhere to your content requirements and apply any custom fields you added to the Case Management Studio base records to your Case Record Chat component.

### Add additional instructions to the chat prompt

The [Records Chat component](Records_Chat_Component.html) has an `additional instructions` parameter that receives optional instructions that ask the AI model to return output specific to your business's preferred format, logic, or other requirements.

Weâ€™ve included these additional instructions in the `CMGT_RC_AI_PromptForAdditionalInstructions` expression rule. This optional setup step allows you to modify the expression rule to best meet your specific use case and requirements.

### Add more fields to Record Chat

If you add new fields via customization to the Case Management Studio base records, including case, tasks, or comments, you can add them in `CMGT_RC_AI_chooseRecordChatParameters` expression rule.

To add new fields for chat, simply follow the pattern that is already available in the `CMGT_RC_AI_chooseRecordChatParameters` expression rule.

## Next step

Now that you have set up the [Case Record Chat](cm-case-record-chat-overview.html) module, you can engage with an AI chatbot to gain additional insights on a case.
