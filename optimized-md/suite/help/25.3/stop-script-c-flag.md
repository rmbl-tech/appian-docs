The `--cluster` (or `-c`) flag for the [stop.sh script](Service_Manager_Scripts.html#stop-script) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

This flag was required to successfully stop the entire Service Manager cluster in a high-availability Appian configuration.

This behavior is now the default behavior for the stop script.
