Plug-Ins: Display Google Maps in Appian UIs

This video walks you through how to add a Google Maps component plug-in to your interface

Appian provides a [fantastic array of components](SAIL_Components.html) that can be used to build beautiful and [powerful user interfaces](sail/home.html) quickly. These components are one of the key building blocks that make Appian's low-code platform so efficient, effective, and a joy to use.

However, there might be rare instances when your interface requirements extend beyond those out-of-the-box components to where there isn't an option that precisely matches your design needs.

Maybe you want to embed **Google Maps** in your interface and allow users to select locations to be passed into an action. Or you might want to capture signatures using **DocuSign** without users having to leave a task form.

Appian offers a user interface software development kit (UI SDK) that is perfectly suited to help developers serve these use cases.

With the UI SDK, developers can extend Appian's already powerful, low-code capabilities by creating custom SAIL components, called [component plug-ins](component-plugins.html), so you can deliver fully on the promise of your interface designs.

Regardless of your role, the UI SDK provides great benefits:

-   For vendors: Create branded, low-code integrations to your platform and ship them with your logo in the Appian AppMarket.
-   For partners: Deliver Appian solutions that feature compelling user interfaces and integrations that are easier for developers to modify and extend.
-   For teams: Handle complex design challenges to deliver on unique customer requirements.
