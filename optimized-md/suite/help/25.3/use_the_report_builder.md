This feature has been deprecated, and will be removed in a future release of Appian.

To easily build reports, use a record type as the source of your [read-only grids](read-only-grid-configuration.html) and [charts](Chart_Configuration_Using_Records.html). Using a records-powered component, you can easily reference record data and reuse existing features configured in the record type.
