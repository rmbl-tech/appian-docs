**Tip:**  Interface patterns give you an opportunity to explore different interface designs. Be sure to check out [How to Adapt a Pattern for Your Application](Adapt_a_SAIL_Recipe_to_Work_with_My_Applications.html).

## Goal

Use this pattern when displaying a chronological list of messages from different users, such as comments on a topic or notes on a case. This page explains how you can use this pattern in your interface, and walks through the design structure in detail.

## With user initials

You can display a user's initials with their message by using a stamp with text for the initials and a user record link for the display name.

Use the "Secondary" rich text color for the time field and align components using a side by side layout.
