**Tip:**  Interface patterns give you an opportunity to explore different interface designs. Be sure to check out [How to Adapt a Pattern for Your Application](Adapt_a_SAIL_Recipe_to_Work_with_My_Applications.html).

## Goal

This is a feature-rich, interactive report for sales and profits by products over select periods of time. This page explains how you can use this pattern in your interface, and walks through the design structure in detail.

## Design structure

The main components in this pattern are box layout, rich text display, and chart components that show a break down of profits, sales, and costs per year, month, and product. The components are organized in side by side layouts nested within columns layouts.

The image below displays how the pattern looks on a blank interface with callouts of the main components.

![screenshot of the pattern explaining the main components. The first is a box containing rich text and icons in a side by side layout. The second is a dropdown field acting as a filter. The third are cards with rich text and dynamic links. The fourth are bar and column charts.](images/patterns/year_over_year_callouts.png)

### Pattern expression

To add this pattern to your interface, from a blank interface object, under **EXAMPLES** click **YEAR OVER YEAR REPORT** or click **Copy expression** in the code box below.

The pattern introduces a 406-line expression to the interface.
